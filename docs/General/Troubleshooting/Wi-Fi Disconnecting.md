# Wi-Fi Disconnecting

1. Try a couple of different power cord and power brick combinations - this matters a lot more than you'd think!
2. Check to see if the sensor's hotspot is showing up. (this means it is not connected to a network)
3. Check the router's connected devices - the device will show up with the Apollo name and a 6 digit hex value of the end of the mac address.
4. Disable power save mode in esphome [Power Save Mode.](https://esphome.io/components/wifi.html#power-save-mode "Power Save Mode")
