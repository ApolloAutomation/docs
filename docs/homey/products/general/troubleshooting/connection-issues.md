# Common Connection Issues

1\. Try a couple of different power cord and power brick combinations - this matters a lot more than you'd think!

2\. Check to see if the sensor's hotspot is showing up. (this means it is not connected to a network)

3\. Check the router's connected devices - the device will show up with the Apollo name and a 6 digit hex value of the end of the mac address.

!!! tip "Look at the mDNS wiki articles as well"

    mDNS is something that is used to tell what devices are seen on the network and if there are firewall issues or mDNS traffic is not being forwarded then there can be issues with Auto Discovery.
