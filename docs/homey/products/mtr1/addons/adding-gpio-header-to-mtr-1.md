4\. Keep the "X" aligned on both sides and gently push down until it securely seats in the small mezzanine connector.

5\. Align the new back for your MTR-1 that came with the GPIO Header addon. Push down on the corners closest to the GPIO Header addon first, and then push the back on securely on the other two corners.

6\. The case should sit flush and you're now ready to add functionality to your device!
