The PLT-1B (18650 battery) is equipped with a capacitive soil moisture sensor, providing enhanced accuracy and durability over resistive alternatives. The sensor’s ground contact portion is coated with a conformal layer, ensuring long-lasting performance and resistance to environmental factors. It also features an AHT20-F air temperature and humidity sensor, which includes dust protection, an LTR390 UV sensor for Lux/UV measurements, an RGB LED, a piezo buzzer, and an optional DS18b20 waterproof soil temperature probe (20 cm / 7.8 inches).

**Optional Probe Addons:**

* 1\.5m (~5ft) Waterproof Flat Cable (DS18B20) – -55°C to 85°C (-67°F to 185°F), ±0.5°C accuracy. Ideal for fridges, freezers, fish tanks etc.

* 20cm (~8in) Waterproof Flat Cable (DS18B20) – -55°C to 85°C (-67°F to 185°F), ±0.5°C accuracy.

!!! danger "Do not leave your sensor outside or let it get wet!"

    The PLT-1 should not be left outside for long periods of time or allowed to get wet. You will need to use another case around your PLT-1 if there will be high moisture content in the air or if it is expected to rain.
