1\. Monitoring fridge / freezer: There are settings to set the maximum temperature the sensor should reach. It can alert through the onboard buzzer if it rises above that temperature. The cable on the probe is flat to not interfere with fridge seals.

2\. Monitoring fish tank, hot tub ( if covered ), pool ( if covered or in sealed box ) with the waterproof probe.

3\. Monitoring grilling, baking, or other food activities with the food safe probe
