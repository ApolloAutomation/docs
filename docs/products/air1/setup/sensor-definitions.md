# Sensor Definitions

Once added to Home Assistant you can configure different settings for your sensor. Below is what each setting does.

### Controls

**Calibrate SCD40 to 420ppm** **CO<sub>2</sub>**

* A control option to <a href="https://wiki.apolloautomation.com/products/general/calibrating-and-updating/co2-calibration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">calibrate the SCD40 CO₂ sensor</a> to <a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/carbon-dioxide/?intent=121" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outdoor baseline levels.</a>

**Clean SEN55**

* This control allows you to clean the SEN55 sensor, likely clearing any temporary issues or re-calibrating.

**RGB Light**

* Three RGB Neopixel LEDs. Click on the light bulb or color wheel to change the color. Click on the toggle to turn on or off.

### Sensors

**Ammonia (NH₃)**

* Measures the concentration of ammonia in the air, which can come from agricultural emissions, cleaning products, or industrial processes.

**Carbon Monoxide (CO)**

* Detects the concentration of carbon monoxide, a dangerous, odorless gas typically produced by combustion.
* **Baseline is 4.16ppm not 0 ppm**.

**(Carbon Dioxide (CO₂)**

* Tracks CO₂ levels in parts per million (ppm), which can indicate poor ventilation and impact overall air quality and cognitive performance. True NDIR CO<sub>2</sub> reading from the SCD40. This will be Unknown if you do not have the CO<sub>2</sub> module. You can <a href="https://wiki.apolloautomation.com/products/general/calibrating-and-updating/co2-calibration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">re-calibrate the SCD40 CO₂ sensor</a> to <a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/carbon-dioxide/?intent=121" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outdoor baseline levels.</a>

**DPS310 Pressure**

* Measures air pressure in psi (pounds per square inch), providing insights into atmospheric changes and enhancing the accuracy of CO₂ readings.

**Ethanol (C₂H₅OH)**

* Detects ethanol vapors, commonly found in cleaning agents, sanitizers, or alcohol-based products.

**Hydrogen (H₂)**

* Monitors the concentration of hydrogen gas, which can indicate leaks or industrial processes.

**Methane (CH₄)**

* Detects methane concentrations, which can indicate natural gas leaks or emissions from agricultural activities.
* **Detects measurements of greater than 1000ppm**(Methane CH4 )

**Nitrogen Dioxide (NO₂)**

* Measures the levels of nitrogen dioxide, a harmful gas often produced by vehicle emissions and industrial processes.

**PM &lt;10µm Weight Concentration**

* Tracks particulate matter smaller than 10 micrometers (PM10), which includes dust, pollen, and mold.

**PM &lt;1µm Weight Concentration**

* Monitors the concentration of ultra-fine particles smaller than 1 micrometer, often present in smoke or exhaust.

**PM &lt;2.5µm Weight Concentration**

* Measures particles smaller than 2.5 micrometers (PM2.5), which are generated by combustion and industrial activities.

**PM &lt;4µm Weight Concentration**

* Detects particulate matter smaller than 4 micrometers.

**SEN55 Temperature**

* Tracks ambient air temperature to help assess comfort levels and environmental conditions.

**SEN55 Humidity**

* Measures relative humidity in the air, which impacts comfort and the overall environment.

**SEN55 NOX Index**

* Monitors nitrogen oxides (NOX index), harmful gases produced by burning fossil fuels and industrial processes.

**SEN55 VOC Index**

Detects volatile organic compounds (VOC Index), which are emitted from paints, cleaning products, and industrial chemicals. <a href="https://sensirion.com/media/documents/02232963/6294E043/Info_Note_VOC_Index.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">VOC index from the SEN55</a>.

**VOC Quality** -This uses the <a href="https://sensirion.com/media/documents/ACD82D45/6294DFC0/Info_Note_Integration_VOC_NOx_Sensor.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">VOC index and a scale to output an easier to use variable</a>

0-79: **Improved** -&gt; 80-149: **Normal** -&gt; 150-249: **Abnormal** -&gt; 250-399: **Very abnormal** -&gt; 400+: **Extremely abnormal**

**PM 0.3 To 1 µm**

* Monitors particles in the range of 0.3 to 1 micrometer. Disabled by default.

**PM 1 To 2.5 µm**

* Tracks particles between 1 and 2.5 micrometers. Disabled by default.

**PM 2.5 To 4 µm**

* Measures particulate matter between 2.5 and 4 micrometers. Disabled by default.

**PM 4 To 10 µm**

* Detects particles between 4 and 10 micrometers. Disabled by default.

### Configuration

* **ESP Reboot**
  * Performs a restart of the sensor
* **SEN55 Temperature Offset**
  * Allows you to calibrate the SEN55 temperature. Please refer to our [calibration guide](https://wiki.apolloautomation.com/products/general/temp-hum-calibration/ "MSR-1 Temperature &amp; Humidity Offsets").
* **SEN55 Humidity Offset**
  * Allows you to calibrate the SEN55 humidity. Please refer to our [calibration guide](https://wiki.apolloautomation.com/products/general/temp-hum-calibration/ "MSR-1 Temperature &amp; Humidity Offsets").

#### Configuration:

**ESP Reboot**

* A button to restart the ESP32 microcontroller running the AIR-1 sensor, helpful for troubleshooting or refreshing connections.

**Prevent Sleep**

* Ability to put AIR-1 to sleep to get better temperature and humidity measurements.

**SEN55 Humidity Offset**

* Allows you to adjust the humidity readings for calibration purposes.

**SEN55 Temperature Offset**

* Lets you calibrate the temperature sensor by adjusting the offset in degrees Celsius.

#### Diagnostic:

**ESP Temperature**

* Displays the internal temperature of the ESP32 microcontroller (112.6°F shown), which is often higher than ambient due to the processor’s activity.

**Firmware Update**

* Shows the status of firmware updates (currently unavailable).

**Online**

* Shows the connection status of the device (Connected).

**RSSI**

* Displays the signal strength of the Wi-Fi connection (-61 dBm shown), which can impact the sensor’s performance if too weak.

**Uptime**

* How long the device has been online without rebooting.
