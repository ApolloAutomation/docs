# BTN-1 Attaching Switches and Keys

!!! tip "Protip: You can use your own mx cherry red, brown, blue etc switches!"

    We sell mx cherry brown switches because they are mostly silent, however, some people prefer a very "clicky" switch. You are able to buy off the shelf mechanical keyboard switches and place them on your BTN-1!
