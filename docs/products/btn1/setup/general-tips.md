### Sticky Pads

Your BTN-1 comes with two sets of 4 sticky pads or feet to stick on the bottom of the BTN-1 itself or on the optional BTN-1 Mount addon. These are great for just setting the device on your desk!

### Mounting

The BTN-1 with the stand addon allows you to mount the device using M3 screws to attach using one of three mounting scenarios as shown below. It also allows for magnetic mounting from one orientation!

###### Desk Mount

I used a block of wood instead of mounting it directly to my desk in this example.
