# Reflashing The BTN-1

!!! info "If your device becomes unresponsive and you've exhausted the other troubleshooting methods you can reflash the factory firmware by following the steps below."

    This factory re-flash needs to be done in Chrome, Edge, or another Chromium based browser.

1\. Disconnect your PUMP-1 from power. With the device facing you, locate the boot button—it’s the button on the right.

!!! danger "Empty the water reservoir and make sure no water is present in the tubes"

    Make sure that there is no water which is able to damage the device. This is a precautionary measure just to be safe!

2\. Plug in a USB cable that supports power and data into your computer.

3\. Push and hold the boot button (the right button). While still holding the button down, plug in a USB-C cable into the USB-C port of your PUMP-1 then let go of the button.
