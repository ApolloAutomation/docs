# Teardown and Reassembly Of BTN-1

###### Disassembly

!!! warning "If you have a BTN-1 with a battery you should flip the power switch to off"

    The BTN-1 ships with a lithium ion battery, however, this means it needs a master shutoff switch, which is on the left side of your BTN-1

1\. Flip the battery switch towards you to the off position. Users with no battery skip to step 2.
