# CO<sub>2</sub> Calibration - The Quick method - Desktop Only not mobile

This article will guide you through a simple calibration of your CO<sub>2</sub> sensor for any Apollo Automation device!

1\. Plug in your sensor outdoors and leave it for at least 5 minutes to allow the readings to stabilize. This should be around [420 ppm per NASA](https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/carbon-dioxide/?intent=121 "NASA CO<sub>2</sub> levels").

2\. Go to your home assistant dashboard and hit the letter "e" - It will pop up with an entity filter and here we will type in "Calibrate CO<sub>2</sub>" and select the correct device.

!!! tip "Hint"

    If you cannot get this menu to pop-up, click somewhere on the [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) dashboard then press your "e" key.
