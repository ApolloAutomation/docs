The Apollo H-1 is our special holiday ornament, designed to bring festive cheer to your home while supporting a good cause. As the first in our annual series, this ornament is crafted with both functionality and community spirit in mind. All proceeds from the H-1 go directly to a local charity in Lexington, KY, reflecting our commitment to giving back and celebrating the season alongside our community.

The H-1 is pre-flashed with a playful firmware featuring three classic holiday songs. With just a press of the gold button on the back, you can enjoy the tunes with synchronized LED effects: one press for Sleigh Bells, two presses for Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, and long press for Let it Snow. Each song brings its own light show, making the H-1 both fun and festive right out of the box.

For those looking to personalize their experience, the H-1 can also be integrated with Home Assistant, transforming it into a “smart” ornament. Through this setup, you can customize songs, LED effects, and create unique holiday automations to suit your style.

With the Apollo H-1, we’re blending holiday joy, smart home innovation, and community spirit into a single ornament, making it a perfect addition to any festive setup.
