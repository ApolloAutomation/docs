4\. **Add to Home Assistant** (Optional)

For additional customization, you will need to flash the [smart H-2 firmware](https://wiki.apolloautomation.com/products/h1/code/) and then connect to Home Assistant following the [setup guide](https://wiki.apolloautomation.com/products/general/setup/getting-started/). With Home Assistant you can add new songs, change LED effects, and create custom automations.

5\. **Enjoy Your Ornament**

Hang the H-2 on your tree, place it on a mantel, or incorporate it into any holiday setup for added joy. Your Apollo H-2 is now ready to spread holiday cheer! Enjoy the festive tunes and LED effects, and feel free to share your unique setup with us in the community!
