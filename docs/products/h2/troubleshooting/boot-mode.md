!!! info "This will cover how to put the H-2 into boot mode."

    This is needed to force the device into boot mode to reflash the firmware.

## **Boot Button Only**

!!! tip "Make sure that the battery is removed prior to putting it in boot mode"

    Make sure that there is no battery in the device - the battery will prevent it from entering boot mode.

1\. Disconnect your H-2 from power. With the device facing you, locate the boot button—it’s the small black button on the right.

2\. Plug in a USB cable that supports power and data into your computer.

3\. Push and hold the boot button (the right button). While still holding the button down, plug in a USB-C cable into the USB-C port of your H-2 then let go of the button.
