# Reflashing The H-2

!!! info "If your device becomes unresponsive and you've exhausted the other troubleshooting methods you can reflash the factory firmware by following the steps below."

    This factory re-flash needs to be done in Chrome, Edge, or another Chromium based browser.

1\. Disconnect your H-2 from power. With the device facing you, locate the boot button - it’s the small black button on the right.

2\. Plug in a USB cable that supports power and data into your computer.

3\. Push and hold the boot button (the right button). While still holding the button down, plug in a USB-C cable into the USB-C port of your H-2 then let go of the button.

    Your device is still in boot mode and needs to be power cycled aka power removed to make it boot in a normal mode!
