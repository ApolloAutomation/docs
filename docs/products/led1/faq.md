1\. **What is the maximum power output of the LED-1?**

* The LED-1 is able to safely offer 10 amps of power using either 5V, 12V, or a 24V power supply.
* The device can also be powered via USB-C-PD (Power Delivery) with 5V or 12V.
* The device has a built-in re-settable fuse that will trip if this is exceeded. The output voltage is the same as the input voltage, so please make sure you buy the same 5V, or 12V, or 24V power supply and LED strips.

2\. **How long of an LED strip can I use with the LED-1?**

* The length of LED strips depends more on other factors like voltage drop. Ultimately, we suggest going 3meters with 5v for each output, so 3meters + 3 meters connected to separate outputs. You can go up to 5 meters at 24v without seeing much voltage drop though!

3\. **Can I use a remote with the LED-1?**

* Although the device does not come with IR, it does <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B091TGDS6F" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">support the WizMote</a> over "ESP-NOW" and this works great inside of WLED!

4\. **How does the microphone work?**

* Audio-reactive WLED is built into the WLED firmware we ship with the LED-1. Just make sure to enable it from the "info" pane and then try using an effect with the little Musical Note Image next to them!
