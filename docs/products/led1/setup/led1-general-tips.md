# General Tips

##### Power Supplies

Meanwell power supplies are best but most power supplies off amazon will be sufficient. As a rule of thumb, over 80% usage on a power supply is bad. So if you want to run with 3amps, buy a 4 or 5amp power supply so that the power supply is not running at its maximum potential amperage.

!!! warning "The LED-1 will output the same voltage that is input and that could damage LEDs!"

    The LED-1 will protect itself, but not the led strips connected to it. So if you connect a 24 volt power supply to the device, it will send 24v out to the LED strips. Make sure to pair your LEDs and Power supplies with the same voltage!

When mounting the MSR-2 be sure to position the device so that the two large holes are not covered. This allows more light to enter and will ensure better accuracy.

##### LED Strips

* WS2812B which are 5V RGB LED strips
* SK6812 which are 5V RGBW LED strips
* WS2814 which are 24V RGBW-CCT FCOB LED strips

!!! tip "Not all LEDs are the same!"

    We suggest buying only BTF Lighting off of amazon or directly from us (we source only BTF Lighting). They also have an Aliexpress store!

##### Additional Tools

You will likely want or need to buy a pack of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/BTF-LIGHTING-Connectors-WS2812B-WS2811-WS2812/dp/B01DC0KIT2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">JST-SM 3 pin connectors</a> to connect multiple led strips or to solder them onto led strips to create multiple smaller sections. These have a maximum rating of 3 amps.

You might want one or both of these 24v FCOB connectors for the WS2814 LEDs suggested above. Make sure to choose the same width of led strip + connector (10mm, 12mm, etc)
