# General Tips

##### Power Supplies

Meanwell power supplies are best but most power supplies off Amazon will be sufficient. As a rule of thumb, over 80% usage on a power supply is bad. So if you want to run with 3amps, buy a 4 or 5amp power supply so that the power supply is not running at its maximum potential amperage.

Most power supplies will have a barrel connector only rated for 3 amps on it, so we suggest that you cut the barrel connector off and split out the red and black wires to put directly into the LED-1.

!!! warning "The LED-1 will output the same voltage that is input and that could damage LEDs!"

    The LED-1 will protect itself, but not the led strips connected to it. So if you connect a 24 volt power supply to the device, it will send 24v out to the LED strips. Make sure to pair your LEDs and Power supplies with the same voltage!

When mounting the MSR-2 be sure to position the device so that the two large holes are not covered. This allows more light to enter and will ensure better accuracy.

##### LED Strips

* <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CDTEG1O" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">WS2812B</a> which are 5V RGB LED strips.
* <a href="https://www.amazon.com/BTF-LIGHTING-Individually-Addressable-Flexible-Non-waterproof/dp/B01N0MA729" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">SK6812</a> which are 5V RGBW LED strips.
* <a href="https://www.amazon.com/BTF-LIGHTING-Flexible-Lighting-Projects-Controller/dp/B0D1V5Y124" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">WS2814</a> which are 24V RGBW-CCT FCOB LED strips.

!!! tip "Not all LEDs are the same!"

    We suggest buying only BTF Lighting off of amazon or directly from us (we source only BTF Lighting). They also have an Aliexpress store!

##### LED Connectors

These have a maximum rating of 3 amps.

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/BTF-LIGHTING-Chasing-Transparent-Connector-Controller/dp/B0CZ36T33F" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">10mm Width Transparent Connector Kit</a> You might want to use these 24v FCOB connectors for the WS2814 LEDs suggested above. Make sure to choose the same width of led strip + connector (10mm, 12mm, etc).

##### Additional Tools

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Compact-Splicing-Connector-Assortment-221-2401/dp/B0CJ5QF3VX" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">Wago Connectors</a> are a great option for connecting wires together without soldering.

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/WGGE-Professional-crimping-Multi-Tool-Multi-Function/dp/B073YG65N2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">Wire Strippers</a> are very helpful especially if you need to cut the end off a barrel connector to expose the red and black wires for powering your device. Make sure they are able to strip 18/20/22 gauge wires.
