# Setup Scrolling Text for the M-1

!!! tip "You can set multiple different custom scrolling text as presets in WLED."

    The WLED firmware on your device will allow you to call these presets in automations or make buttons to control them on your Home Assistant dashboard!

1\. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://<your-ip-address>` or `http://<your-device-name>.local`.

!!! example "Edit settings to fully customize your M-1 with Scrolling Text!"

    There are four slider bars under the Scrolling Text effect. Here is what each one does:<br>1\. **Effect speed**: how slow or fast the text goes across the matrix.

    2\. **Y Offset**: Moves the words higher or lower on the matrix. Defaults to the middle.

    3\. **Trail**: Trail length or Fade (sometimes called *Decay* or *Trail* depending on firmware version) to control how long the trail behind the text lasts.

    4\. **Font size**: Size of the font. 222 looks good!
