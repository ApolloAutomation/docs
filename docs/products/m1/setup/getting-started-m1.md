# Getting Started

Congrats on your new M-1! Below we will go through steps to get you up and running in no time.

#### Connect to Wi-Fi

Your device is ready to connect to your Wi-Fi and begin controlling via Home Assistant, the WLED app for iPhone and Android, or via a web browser!

1\. Plug in the USB-C power in and the M-1 device will boot within a couple seconds. Head to the available Wi-Fi networks on your phone and select WLED-AP. It should pop up saying "Welcome to WLED!". If this popup does not occur, please open a web browser and navigate to <a href="http://4.3.2.1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://4.3.2.1/</a> or <a href="http://wled.me" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">http://wled.me</a> and you should be prompted with the same image seen below.
