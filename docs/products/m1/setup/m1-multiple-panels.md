# M-1 LED Matrix - Multiple Panels

!!! info "Prerequisites needed for multiple panels"

    To use multiple panels you will need one M-1 LED Matrix Controller, at least two M-1 Matrix panels with a maximum of four, at least one of the data cables with a max of three, and at least one of the Power Modules (with a max of three). You will also need up to four usb-c cables to power each panel including the usb-c of the m-1 led matrix which will power the panel it is connected to.

###### Hardware Setup

1\. Set both of your M-1 panels face down - the M-1 controller panel should be on the far left. Start by connecting the data cable (ribbon cable) to the "JOUT" port on the far left panel into the "JIN" port on the second panel.

2\. Gently press the Matrix Power Module over the 4 pin header on the second panel as shown below. Make sure the USB-C port is facing to the right!
