# M-1 LED Matrix - Multiple Panels

!!! info "Prerequisites needed for multiple panels"

    To use multiple panels you will need one M-1 LED Matrix Controller, at least two M-1 Matrix panels with a maximum of four, at least one of the data cables with a max of three, and at least one of the Power Modules (with a max of three). You will also need up to four usb-c cables to power each panel including the usb-c of the m-1 led matrix which will power the panel it is connected to.
