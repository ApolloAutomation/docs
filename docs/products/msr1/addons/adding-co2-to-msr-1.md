3\. Orientate the CO<sub>2</sub> module so the white x on the module is also in the lower right and the gold dot is in the upper left as seen below

4\. Align the connector on the back of the CO<sub>2</sub> module with the connector on the MSR-1. Once aligned, push down so the CO<sub>2</sub> module fully seats itself

5\. Put your MSR-1 back in the case and slide the back cover on. Please refer to our [CO<sub>2</sub> calibration guide](https://wiki.apolloautomation.com/products/general/calibrating-and-updating/co2-calibration/ "CO2 Calibration") to calibrate the CO<sub>2</sub> module.
