3\. Keep the "X" aligned on both sides and gently push down until it securely seats in the small mezzanine connector.

4\. Align the new back for your MSR-2 that came with the GPIO Header addon. Push down on the corners closest to the USB-C addon first, and then push the back on securely on the other two corners.

!!! failure "Known issues with the rear usb-c addons"

    There are sadly limitations regarding the rear usb-c addons from Apollo. We have found that some USB-C power delivery circuits and anker plugs seem to have issues. Any non USB-C-PD circuit at 5volts should work fine!
