4\. Align the connector on the back of the CO2 module with the connector on the MTR-1. Once aligned, push down so the CO2 module fully seats itself

5\. Put your MTR-1 back in the case and slide the back cover on. Please refer to our [CO2 calibration guide](https://wiki.apolloautomation.com/products/general/calibrating-and-updating/co2-calibration/ "CO2 Calibration") to calibrate the CO2 module.
