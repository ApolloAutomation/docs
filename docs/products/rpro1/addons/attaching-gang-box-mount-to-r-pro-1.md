3\. Take the two gang box mount pieces and identify the one labeled "TOP" and the other piece which is the bottom mount.

    If the mounts are not put on properly the R-PRO-1 could be damaged!

3\. Gently push the top mount labeled "TOP" into the pcb as shown below. Make sure the orientation is identical to the image below!
