!!! tip "R-PRO-1 ships with Wi-Fi firmware because some people might not have ethernet or PoE."

    Your device needs to be able to [connect to the internet to switch between firmware files](https://wiki.apolloautomation.com/products/rpro1/setup/rpro1-switch-firmware/). If you are connecting to an IoT network on a subnet/vlan unable to access github.com then this will not work. You can also manually reflash your device serially (usb) by<a href="https://wiki.apolloautomation.com/products/rpro1/troubleshooting/rpro1-code/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener"> following our flashing guide</a>!

The Apollo Automation R PRO-1 PoE mmWave Multisensor (LD2450 and additional LD2412 add-on option) is our most advanced presence sensor. Designed for power, precision, and reliability, the R PRO-1 is a compact PoE mmWave sensor built for high-accuracy motion detection and environmental monitoring in smart homes and commercial buildings.

This versatile sensor supports PoE (802.3af compliant) and USB-C power, and includes built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity, enabling flexible installation and seamless smart home integration. Its small form factor combined with PoE or USB-C power options makes the R PRO-1 ideal for quick deployments in a wall or ceiling.
