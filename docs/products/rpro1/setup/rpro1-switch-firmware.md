# Firmware Switching Guide

!!! tip "R-PRO-1 ships with Wi-Fi firmware because some people might not have ethernet or PoE."

    Your device needs to be able to connect to the internet to switch between firmware files. If you are connecting to an IoT network on a subnet/vlan unable to access github.com then this will not work. You can also manually reflash your device serially (usb) by<a href="https://wiki.apolloautomation.com/products/rpro1/troubleshooting/rpro1-code/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener"> following our flashing guide</a>!
