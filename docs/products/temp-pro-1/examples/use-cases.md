# Use Cases for the TEMP Pro-1

1\. Monitoring fridge / freezer: There are settings to set the maximum temperature the sensor should reach. It can alert through the onboard buzzer if it rises above that temperature. The cable on the probe is flat which should not interfere with fridge seals.

2\. Monitoring fish tank, hot tub ( if covered ), pool ( if covered or in sealed box ) with the waterproof probe.

3\. Monitoring an attic by putting the Temp Pro-1 in a waterproof enclosure or just poking a hole to feed a temp probe into an attic or other environment not suitable for the Temp Pro-1 PCB itself.
