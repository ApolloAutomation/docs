# How to Insert the Battery

!!! info "16340 AKA RC-CR123A and charger required!"

    The TEMP-1B is a very neat sensor but it does *NOT* include a battery nor a charging circuit. You will have to buy your own rechargable RC-CR123A aka 16340 battery and also a separate 16340 charger such as a Nitecore 2 or 4bay model.

1\. Gently pry open the case lid as shown in the image below.

6\. You will use the "ledge" of the case to set the PCB down and then it will lay down and rest on the ledge of the other side as well.
