# How to Insert the Battery

!!! info "16340 AKA RC-CR123A and charger required!"

    The TEMP-1B is a very neat sensor but it does *NOT* include a battery nor a charging circuit. You will have to buy your own <a href="https://apolloautomation.com/products/16340-rechargeable-battery" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">rechargable RC-CR123A aka 16340 battery </a>and also a separate 16340 charger such as a Nitecore 2 or 4bay model.

1\. Gently pry open the case lid as shown in the image below.
