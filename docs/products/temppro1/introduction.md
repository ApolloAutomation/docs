The TEMP Pro-1 can be used with an optional temperature probe which come in two lengths and or dust-proof temp and humidity probe (<a href="https://wiki.dfrobot.com/SHT20_I2C_Temperature_%26_Humidity_Sensor__Waterproof_Probe__SKU__SEN0227" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">SHT20</a>). It also features an AHT20-F air temperature and humidity sensor, 4x RGB LEDs, and a piezo buzzer.

It includes two mezzanine connectors for our GPIO Header addon, CO2 addon, and any future addons using that port. It also includes a Sen5x/Sen6x port which is used to connect the SEN55 on our AIR-1. It even includes a DFrobot port (MiCS port on AIR-1) and a QWIIC port!

**Optional Probe Addons:**

* 1\.5m (~5ft) Waterproof Flat Cable (DS18B20) -55°C to 85°C (-67°F to 185°F), ±0.5°C accuracy. Ideal for fridges, freezers, fish tanks etc.
* 20cm (~8in) Waterproof Flat Cable (DS18B20) -55°C to 85°C (-67°F to 185°F), ±0.5°C accuracy.
* 12\.7cm (~5 in) dust-proof temperature & humidity sensor with waterproof probe (<a href="https://wiki.dfrobot.com/SHT20_I2C_Temperature_%26_Humidity_Sensor__Waterproof_Probe__SKU__SEN0227" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">SHT20</a>)

!!! danger "Do not leave your sensor outside or let it get wet!"

    The TEMP Pro-1 should not be left outside for long periods of time or allowed to get wet. You will need to use another case around your TEMP Pro-1 if there will be high moisture content in the air or if it is expected to rain. This is also true of attics!
