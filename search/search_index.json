For example, you can automate an HVAC fan to run when CO2 levels are high, or trigger notifications when particulate matter reaches unhealthy levels.</li> </ul> <p>7. How does the optional CO2 sensor work?</p> <ul> <li>The optional SCD40 CO2 sensor measures carbon dioxide levels and helps you understand when CO2 concentrations in a room become too high, which can cause fatigue, drowsiness, and worse for humans and pets alike. It\u2019s particularly useful in offices, bedrooms, and other enclosed spaces.</li> </ul> <p>8. What is particulate matter (PM) and why is it important?</p> <ul> <li>Particulate matter (PM) refers to tiny particles in the air that can be harmful when inhaled. The AIR-1 measures various sizes of particulate matter (PM1, PM2.5, PM4, PM10), helping you track dust, pollen, and other particles that affect air quality. It\u2019s especially useful for people with allergies or respiratory conditions.</li> </ul> <p>9. What is VOC and why should I monitor it?</p> <ul> <li>VOCs (volatile organic compounds) are chemicals that can be emitted from everyday items like cleaning products, paints, and furniture. Prolonged exposure to high levels of VOCs can affect indoor air quality and health. The AIR-1\u2019s VOC sensor helps you monitor these levels and take action when necessary, such as increasing ventilation.</li> </ul> <p>10. What is the NOx Index and why is it measured?</p> <ul> <li>NOx (nitrogen oxides) are harmful gases that contribute to air pollution and can affect respiratory health. The AIR-1 gives an NOx index number, allowing you to keep track of indoor air quality and make adjustments if necessary. \"The NO x Index describes the current NO x condition in a room relative to the sensor\u2019s recent history. In this way, the NO x Index behaves like a human nose. \"</li> </ul> <p>11. How accurate are the air quality readings from the AIR-1?</p> <ul> <li>The AIR-1 uses a high-quality SEN55 sensor with a 10-year lifespan, designed for continuous use.

This way, you avoid having the lights go off while reading a recipe or doing the dishes.</li> </ol> <p>References</p> <ul> <li>https://youtu.be/dAzHXpP3FcI?t=431</li> <li>https://community.home-assistant.io/t/ld2410-esphome-tips/477058/316</li> <li>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l212Lvo1R6s</li> </ul>"},{"location":"homey/products/general/contact-us/Facebook/","title":"Facebook","text":""},{"location":"homey/products/general/contact-us/Facebook/#facebook","title":"Facebook","text":""},{"location":"homey/products/general/contact-us/Facebook/#httpswwwfacebookcomgroups296506776330405","title":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/296506776330405","text":""},{"location":"homey/products/general/contact-us/GitHub/","title":"GitHub","text":""},{"location":"homey/products/general/contact-us/GitHub/#github","title":"GitHub","text":""},{"location":"homey/products/general/contact-us/GitHub/#httpsgithubcomapolloautomation","title":"https://github.com/ApolloAutomation","text":""},{"location":"homey/products/general/contact-us/Instagram/","title":"Instagram","text":""},{"location":"homey/products/general/contact-us/Instagram/#instagram","title":"Instagram","text":"<p>https://www.instagram.com/apollo_automation/</p>"},{"location":"homey/products/general/contact-us/Reddit/","title":"Reddit","text":""},{"location":"homey/products/general/contact-us/Reddit/#reddit","title":"Reddit","text":""},{"location":"homey/products/general/contact-us/Reddit/#httpswwwredditcomrapolloautomation","title":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ApolloAutomation/","text":""},{"location":"homey/products/general/contact-us/YouTube/","title":"YouTube","text":""},{"location":"homey/products/general/contact-us/YouTube/#youtube","title":"YouTube","text":"<p>http://www.youtube.com/@ApolloAutomation</p>"},{"location":"homey/products/general/contact-us/apollo-automation-shop/","title":"Apollo automation shop","text":""},{"location":"homey/products/general/contact-us/contact-us-support/","title":"Our Team Page","text":""},{"location":"homey/products/general/contact-us/contact-us-support/#our-team-page","title":"Our Team Page","text":""},{"location":"homey/products/general/contact-us/contact-us-support/#shop","title":"Shop","text":""},{"location":"homey/products/general/contact-us/contact-us-support/#discord-dedicated-support","title":"Discord (Dedicated Support)","text":""},{"location":"homey/products/general/contact-us/contact-us-support/#github","title":"GitHub","text":""},{"location":"homey/products/general/contact-us/contact-us-support/#youtube","title":"YouTube","text":""},{"location":"homey/products/general/contact-us/contact-us-support/#reddit","title":"Reddit","text":""},{"location":"homey/products/general/contact-us/contact-us-support/#facebook","title":"Facebook","text":""},{"location":"homey/products/general/contact-us/contact-us-support/#instagram","title":"Instagram","text":""},{"location":"homey/products/general/contact-us/contact-us-support/#support-email-supportapolloautomationcom","title":"Support Email: support@apolloautomation.com","text":""},{"location":"homey/products/general/contact-us/contact-us-support/#_1","title":"Our Team Page","text":""},{"location":"homey/products/general/contact-us/our-team/","title":"Our team","text":""},{"location":"homey/products/general/setup/adding-apollo-devices-to-hidden-networks/","title":"Adding Apollo Devices To Hidden Networks","text":""},{"location":"homey/products/general/setup/adding-apollo-devices-to-hidden-networks/#adding-apollo-devices-to-hidden-networks","title":"Adding Apollo Devices To Hidden Networks","text":"<p>1.

What sensors are included in the MSR-2?</p> <ul> <li>The MSR-2 includes several built-in sensors such as an mmWave radar for motion detection, a LUX and UV sensor, a temperature and pressure sensor, and an optional CO2 sensor.</li> </ul> <p>2. How does the mmWave radar sensor work?</p> <ul> <li>The mmWave radar sensor can detect movement, even subtle motions like someone sitting still in a room. It works by emitting radar waves that reflect off objects and detects motion based on the change in the signal. The sensor is highly effective in detecting people in a room, even through light walls.</li> </ul> <p>3. What is the maximum detection range of the mmWave radar?</p> <ul> <li>The HLK-LD2410B mmWave radar sensor has a maximum detection range of about 6 meters (19.6 feet) with multi-target tracking capabilities, making it ideal for room-wide monitoring.</li> </ul> <p>4. Can the MSR-2 detect multiple people?</p> <ul> <li>No, the MSR-2 supports single-target tracking only but it has better still detection than the MTR-1 which makes it uniquely suited for situations where you need to track a very still target like on a bed, couch, etc.</li> </ul> <p>5. What is the benefit of the LUX and UV sensor?</p> <ul> <li>The LUX sensor measures the amount of light in a room, while the UV sensor tracks the ultraviolet index from the sun. These readings can be used to automate lighting systems, such as turning on or off lights depending on the ambient brightness, or to measure sunlight exposure in a room.</li> </ul> <p>6. How does the optional CO2 sensor work?</p> <ul> <li>The optional SCD-40 CO2 sensor provides accurate carbon dioxide measurements and is useful for tracking air quality in enclosed spaces. This sensor can be used to automate HVAC systems, sending alerts when CO2 levels are too high and suggesting when to ventilate the area.</li> </ul> <p>7. How do I connect the MSR-2 to Home Assistant?</p> <ul> <li>The MSR-2 connects to your Home Assistant instance through ESPHome using WiFi. Once connected, you can monitor data from all the sensors and set up automations.</li> </ul> <p>8. What kind of automations can I create with the MSR-2?</p> <ul> <li>You can create a variety of automations, such as turning on lights when motion is detected, adjusting ventilation when CO2 levels rise, or triggering alarms based on motion or environmental changes.</li> </ul> <p>9. What are the RGB LED and piezo buzzer used for?</p> <ul> <li>The RGB LED provides visual alerts, while the piezo buzzer offers audio notifications for events like low moisture levels or high UV exposure.</li> </ul> <p>10. How do I adjust the sensitivity of the presence detection?</p> <ul> <li>Sensitivity adjustments can be made through the Home Assistant Device Page or HLK Radar Tool app allowing you to fine-tune the radar to avoid false positives or to increase its sensitivity for more precise detections.</li> </ul> <p>11. Does the mmWave sensor detect through walls?</p> <ul> <li>Yes, the mmWave sensor can detect movement through certain materials like thin walls, which is helpful in larger spaces but may require sensitivity adjustments if false positives occur due to adjacent rooms.</li> </ul> <p>12. Can the MSR-2 be used outdoors?</p> <ul> <li>No, the MSR-2 is primarily designed for indoor use and high humidity or temperatures too high or low could damage the device.</li> </ul> <p>13. What\u2019s new in the MSR-2 compared to the MSR-1?</p> <ul> <li>The MSR-2 introduces several improvements, including a smaller form factor, an additional expansion slot for future accessories, an updated DPS310 pressure sensor for more accurate readings, and improved temperature and pressure tracking.</li> </ul> <p>14. Can the MSR-2 track the exact location of people in a room?</p> <ul> <li>Yes, the MSR-2 uses multi-zone mmWave radar technology to track the approximate location of people within a room. It can determine whether someone is sitting, walking, or standing in different areas of the space.</li> </ul> <p>15. How does the temperature and pressure sensor work?</p> <ul> <li>The DPS310 sensor provides precise readings of air temperature and pressure, which are especially useful when combined with the optional CO2 sensor to improve air quality monitoring. Keep in mind the heat generated by the ESP32 may require a temperature offset adjustment in the configuration.</li> </ul> <p>16. What kind of power supply is required for the MSR-2?</p> <ul> <li>The MSR-2 is powered via USB-C and can be plugged into a standard wall outlet using a 5V adapter.</li> </ul> <p>17. Can I customize the MSR-2 functionality?</p> <ul> <li>Absolutely! With ESPHome, users can modify firmware, settings, and even print custom cases for the MSR-2. Our YAML is on Github and our .STEP and .STL CAD files are available for community use.</li> </ul> <p>18. How often does the MSR-2 report sensor data?</p> <ul> <li>The reporting frequency can be customized through the ESPHome YAML configuration. You can set it to report data as frequently as every second or reduce the frequency to save energy or bandwidth.</li> </ul> <p>19. Is the MSR-2 compatible with other smart home platforms?</p> <ul> <li>The MSR-2 is specifically designed for Home Assistant via ESPHome. While it could be compatible with other platforms through custom integrations, its primary functionality is optimized for Home Assistant.</li> </ul> <p>20. Can I use multiple MSR-2 sensors in my Home Assistant setup?</p> <ul> <li>Yes, you can have multiple MSR-2 sensors connected to the same Home Assistant instance. Each device will show up as a separate entity, allowing you to monitor and automate different rooms or areas in your home.</li> </ul> <p>21. What accessories are available for the MSR-2?</p> <ul> <li>The MSR-2 has an additional expansion slot for future accessories. Currently, accessories such as a USB-C wall plug mount and a ball mount for flexible positioning are available. We are also working on new expansion boards for future updates.</li> </ul> <p>22. Is the MSR-2 secure?</p> <ul> <li>The MSR-2 communicates over your local network using ESPHome, which provides a secure, local connection without the need for cloud services. No data is sent to external servers, ensuring privacy.</li> </ul> <p>23. How do I install and configure the MSR-2?</p> <ul> <li>Installation is straightforward, with the MSR-2 powered via USB-C and connecting to Home Assistant through WiFi.

Definitely easier than using the LD2410B app.\"</p> <p>Example</p> <p>- You may have an open-concept kitchen and living room, and you want the MSR-1 to activate your under-cabinet lights only when you're in the kitchen.</p> <p>Here's how:</p> <ol> <li>Stand in the desired trigger locations.</li> <li>Observe the gate energy.</li> <li>Adjust the gate threshold slider to the right, increasing the energy required to trigger the mmWave sensor. This ensures that your kitchen lights only come on when you're actually in the kitchen, not just walking by in the living room. Also, you can lower the gate threshold in the kitchen by moving the slider to the left. This makes the mmWave sensor more sensitive, even when standing still. This way, you avoid having the lights go off while reading a recipe or doing the dishes.</li> </ol> <p>- From clarinetJWD, \"Engineering mode is what I was missing at first. I did exactly that, and now detection is basically perfect! My under cabinet lights now come on to max brightness whenever someone is in the kitchen, and return to their previous value when they leave. Next up is replacing the really flaky motion switch in my garage so it stops shutting off when I'm doing a project at the workbench!

In this tutorial, however, we will be focusing on adding an LED strip to your Apollo device.</p> <p>Materials Needed for tutorial:</p> <ul> <li>Apollo MSR-2, Apollo MTR-1, and all other future Apollo Automation products with the mezzanine port.</li> <li>Apollo GPIO Header</li> <li>ws2812b aka neopixel RGB led strip or similar. sk6812 RGBW strip will also work.</li> <li>Optional DuPont Cables for GPIO Header but any DuPont cables will do.</li> <li>USB-C cable and power brick to power MSR-2</li> </ul> <p>You are limited to 300mA of power output from the 5v port. You can either attach an external power supply and power the MSR-2 via 5v and gnd pins or work with the limited power output of the port</p> <p></p> <p>Above is an image of the GPIO Header and its pinouts. We can use ports 2,4,6,7 for our data channel to an LED strip or multiple LED strips. We will also use the top two ports which are ground and 5v for power.</p> <p>Did you know you can power the esp32 from the 5v and gnd pin? That means you can connect an external power supply and power it without the side USB port being used! This also allows for more power to be given to your LEDs!</p> <p>We cannot use the IO ports 0,1,18, or 19 for LEDs but you can use ports 0 and 1 for i2c sensors.</p> <p>Connecting the GPIO Header to the MSR-2</p> <p>The first thing we will do is remove our MSR-2 back plate and connect our GPIO Header to our MSR-2 and then put the new GPIO back plate on (blue).</p> <p>Step 1. Remove the backplate of the MSR-2</p> <p> </p> <p>Step 2. Line up the Xs shown on the msr-2 and the GPIO Header. They should both be facing in the same direction as shown below.</p> <p></p> <p>Step 3. Gently push down onto the GPIO Header as shown below:</p> <p></p> <p>Step 4. Confirm the GPIO Header is seated properly as shown below.</p> <p></p> <p>Step 5. Slide the GPIO Header back plate for the MSR-2 over your sensor and gently push down until it clicks into place.</p> <p></p> <p>If the back plate does not gently go onto the sensor please investigate and confirm it is in the right orientation.</p> <p>Connecting DuPont pins to proper GPIO ports Now we need to reference the GPIO pinout we looked at above and then connect three wires. You will need three male-to-male DuPont wires included in your kit. I suggest using red for power aka 5v, White for ground aka GND, and green for data aka port IO7. Most LED strips will also have this same color scheme and it's easier to match like colors together.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>You can add a bit of hot glue to the Dupont wires to hold them together. DO NOT put hot glue into the GPIO Header's female pins that will ruin the addon. I am only suggesting that you can hot-glue the Dupont pins outer shell themselves together to stiffen them up.</p> <p></p> <p>Connecting DuPont pins to LED Strip</p> <p>Next, we need to connect the other side of the Dupont pins to the LED strip. Most likely your LED strip will have a JST-SM connector which is a 3amp max connector with three wires connected: red for 5v, green for data, and white for gnd. We will be matching up our red, green, and white wires already attached to the GPIO add-on pins in the MSR-2 (using IO7 as the data pin for this tutorial)</p> <p> </p> <p>Make sure to connect to the correct side of the LED strip. The led strip will have an arrow going down the led strip showing one direction for the data line. you want the data channel going FROM the msr-2 TO the led strip going in a \"forward\" direction as shown below.</p> <p> </p> <p>Edit the YAML of your MSR-2 to let it know about your new LED strip</p> <p>Finally, we need to tell the MSR-2 that we connected an LED strip. We need to tell it how many LEDs we have and we need to tell it that it's our second LED since the built-in LED is the first. This tutorial assumes you are comfortable with the ESPHome dashboard.</p> <p>Step 1. Open ESPhome Dashboard and click edit to bring up the yaml your sensor is currently using.</p> <p></p> <p>You will see some YAML code here and you do NOT want to touch anything above line 20. If you need to, click your cursor at the end of wifi_password and hit enter to create a new line then make sure you backspace until you are \"flush\" with the line numbers like how wifi: is.</p> <p>Step 2. Copy the code below and paste it to line 20 in your ESPHome yaml for this device.</p> <pre><code>light:\n  - platform: esp32_rmt_led_strip\n    id: bed_led\n    name: \"Bed LED\"\n    pin: GPIO7\n    rmt_channel: 1\n    default_transition_length: 0s\n    chipset: WS2812\n    num_leds: 60\n    rgb_order: grb\n    effects:\n      - pulse:\n          name: \"Slow Pulse\"\n          transition_length: 1000ms\n          update_interval: 1000ms\n          min_brightness: 50%\n          max_brightness: 100%\n      - pulse:\n          name: \"Fast Pulse\"\n          transition_length: 100ms\n          update_interval: 100ms\n          min_brightness: 50%\n          max_brightness: 100%\n      - addressable_rainbow:\n</code></pre> <p>This is where you can change your number of LEDs as well as the GPIO pin used for the LED data! Make sure to check out https://esphome.io/components/light/index.html#light-effects for all the effects supported such as addressable scan effect!Step 3. Confirm you do not have any red lines showing errors in your code You change the rmt_channel to 1 because 0 is being used by the built-in LED of the MSR-2. Step 4. Hit save and then install in the top right. It should have a popup where you select \"wirelessly\" then it will begin compiling the firmware and finally installing the compiled firmware to your MSR-2.Step 5. Go into home assistant and confirm you now have a new light entity called Bed LED</p> <p></p> <p>Step 6. Click on the name \"Bed LED\" circled and it will pop up a color picker. You can then choose the color wheel option to pick any color of the rainbow, or select \"effect\" and choose an effect.</p> <p> </p> <p></p> <p>That's all folks!

Does the MTR-1 work with other smart home platforms?</p> <ul> <li>The MTR-1 is designed to work seamlessly with Home Assistant via ESPHome. While it could potentially be integrated into other smart home platforms through custom configurations, its primary use case is for Home Assistant.</li> </ul> <p>15. How does the temperature and pressure sensor work?</p> <ul> <li>The temperature and pressure sensor provides accurate measurements for air temperature and barometric pressure. This data can be used in automations, such as controlling heating/cooling systems or monitoring environmental conditions.</li> </ul> <p>16. How is the MTR-1 powered?</p> <ul> <li>The MTR-1 is powered through a USB-C connection and can be plugged into a standard wall outlet using a 5V adapter.</li> </ul> <p>17. What is the purpose of the RGB LED and piezo buzzer?</p> <ul> <li>The RGB LED can display different colors for various events or alerts, such as turning red when air quality is poor or green for general notifications. The piezo buzzer can be used for sound alerts, such as a beep when motion is detected or a CO2 level warning.</li> </ul> <p>18. Can I customize the MTR-1\u2019s features?</p> <ul> <li>Yes, the MTR-1 is fully customizable through ESPHome. You can modify sensor settings, change reporting intervals, and create custom automations based on the sensor readings.</li> </ul> <p>19. What is the reporting frequency of the MTR-1\u2019s sensors?</p> <ul> <li>The reporting frequency for each sensor can be adjusted through the ESPHome YAML configuration. You can choose to report data as frequently as every second or extend the intervals to reduce power consumption.</li> </ul> <p>20. Can I use multiple MTR-1 sensors in my smart home setup?</p> <ul> <li>Yes, you can integrate multiple MTR-1 sensors into your Home Assistant system. Each will show up as a separate entity, allowing you to monitor multiple rooms or areas in your home simultaneously.</li> </ul> <p>21. What\u2019s the difference between the MTR-1 and MSR-2?</p> <ul> <li>The MTR-1 features multi-target radar tracking, allowing it to detect multiple people in a room and track their positions. The MSR-2, on the other hand, is designed more for single-target detection and has a slightly different sensor set, though both sensors offer robust environmental monitoring capabilities.</li> </ul> <p>22.

In this tutorial, however, we will be focusing on adding an LED strip to your Apollo device.</p> <p>Materials Needed for tutorial:</p> <ul> <li>Apollo MSR-2, Apollo MTR-1, and all other future Apollo Automation products with the mezzanine port.</li> <li>Apollo GPIO Header</li> <li>ws2812b aka neopixel RGB led strip or similar. sk6812 RGBW strip will also work.</li> <li>Optional DuPont Cables for GPIO Header but any DuPont cables will do.</li> <li>USB-C cable and power brick to power MSR-2</li> </ul> <p>You are limited to 300mA of power output from the 5v port. You can either attach an external power supply and power the MSR-2 via 5v and gnd pins or work with the limited power output of the port</p> <p></p> <p>Above is an image of the GPIO Header and its pinouts. We can use ports 2,4,6,7 for our data channel to an LED strip or multiple LED strips. We will also use the top two ports which are ground and 5v for power.</p> <p>Did you know you can power the esp32 from the 5v and gnd pin? That means you can connect an external power supply and power it without the side USB port being used! This also allows for more power to be given to your LEDs!</p> <p>We cannot use the IO ports 0,1,18, or 19 for LEDs but you can use ports 0 and 1 for i2c sensors.</p> <p>Connecting the GPIO Header to the MSR-2</p> <p>The first thing we will do is remove our MSR-2 back plate and connect our GPIO Header to our MSR-2 and then put the new GPIO back plate on (blue).</p> <p>Step 1. Remove the backplate of the MSR-2</p> <p> </p> <p>Step 2. Line up the Xs shown on the msr-2 and the GPIO Header. They should both be facing in the same direction as shown below.</p> <p></p> <p>Step 3. Gently push down onto the GPIO Header as shown below:</p> <p></p> <p>Step 4. Confirm the GPIO Header is seated properly as shown below.</p> <p></p> <p>Step 5. Slide the GPIO Header back plate for the MSR-2 over your sensor and gently push down until it clicks into place.</p> <p></p> <p>If the back plate does not gently go onto the sensor please investigate and confirm it is in the right orientation.</p> <p>Connecting DuPont pins to proper GPIO ports Now we need to reference the GPIO pinout we looked at above and then connect three wires. You will need three male-to-male DuPont wires included in your kit. I suggest using red for power aka 5v, White for ground aka GND, and green for data aka port IO7. Most LED strips will also have this same color scheme and it's easier to match like colors together.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>You can add a bit of hot glue to the Dupont wires to hold them together. DO NOT put hot glue into the GPIO Header's female pins that will ruin the addon. I am only suggesting that you can hot-glue the Dupont pins outer shell themselves together to stiffen them up.</p> <p></p> <p>Connecting DuPont pins to LED Strip</p> <p>Next, we need to connect the other side of the Dupont pins to the LED strip. Most likely your LED strip will have a JST-SM connector which is a 3amp max connector with three wires connected: red for 5v, green for data, and white for gnd. We will be matching up our red, green, and white wires already attached to the GPIO add-on pins in the MSR-2 (using IO7 as the data pin for this tutorial)</p> <p> </p> <p>Make sure to connect to the correct side of the LED strip. The led strip will have an arrow going down the led strip showing one direction for the data line. you want the data channel going FROM the msr-2 TO the led strip going in a \"forward\" direction as shown below.</p> <p> </p> <p>Edit the YAML of your MSR-2 to let it know about your new LED strip</p> <p>Finally, we need to tell the MSR-2 that we connected an LED strip. We need to tell it how many LEDs we have and we need to tell it that it's our second LED since the built-in LED is the first. This tutorial assumes you are comfortable with the ESPHome dashboard.</p> <p>Step 1. Open ESPhome Dashboard and click edit to bring up the yaml your sensor is currently using.</p> <p></p> <p>You will see some YAML code here and you do NOT want to touch anything above line 20. If you need to, click your cursor at the end of wifi_password and hit enter to create a new line then make sure you backspace until you are \"flush\" with the line numbers like how wifi: is.</p> <p>Step 2. Copy the code below and paste it to line 20 in your ESPHome yaml for this device.</p> <pre><code>light:\n  - platform: esp32_rmt_led_strip\n    id: bed_led\n    name: \"Bed LED\"\n    pin: GPIO7\n    rmt_channel: 1\n    default_transition_length: 0s\n    chipset: WS2812\n    num_leds: 60\n    rgb_order: grb\n    effects:\n      - pulse:\n          name: \"Slow Pulse\"\n          transition_length: 1000ms\n          update_interval: 1000ms\n          min_brightness: 50%\n          max_brightness: 100%\n      - pulse:\n          name: \"Fast Pulse\"\n          transition_length: 100ms\n          update_interval: 100ms\n          min_brightness: 50%\n          max_brightness: 100%\n      - addressable_rainbow:\n</code></pre> <p>This is where you can change your number of LEDs as well as the GPIO pin used for the LED data! Make sure to check out https://esphome.io/components/light/index.html#light-effects for all the effects supported such as addressable scan effect!Step 3. Confirm you do not have any red lines showing errors in your code You change the rmt_channel to 1 because 0 is being used by the built-in LED of the MSR-2. Step 4. Hit save and then install in the top right. It should have a popup where you select \"wirelessly\" then it will begin compiling the firmware and finally installing the compiled firmware to your MSR-2.Step 5. Go into home assistant and confirm you now have a new light entity called Bed LED</p> <p></p> <p>Step 6. Click on the name \"Bed LED\" circled and it will pop up a color picker. You can then choose the color wheel option to pick any color of the rainbow, or select \"effect\" and choose an effect.</p> <p> </p> <p></p> <p>That's all folks!

It's much easier to tune using the HLK Radartool App and we suggest using that to set up your MTR-1.</p> <p>1. Install HACS.</p> <p>2. Download Plotly inside HACS.</p> <p>3. Enter your device\u2019s full name and optionally customize the names of the three zones using the tool below. Then click Generate YAML and Copy YAML.If you're unsure of your device name, go to the ESPHome Integrations page, select your device, and look for the full name. Unless you\u2019ve renamed it, it will likely be something like \"apollo_r_mtr_1_c64a28\", with six random characters at the end.</p> <p> </p> <p>4. Head to a dashboard view and click the pencil icon to edit dashboard then click one of the large \"+\" signs, type in manual, and click on it.</p> <p></p> <p>5. Delete any text in the custom card then paste the YAML you copied above and click save when finished. You should now have a custom card that looks just like the card below!</p> <p></p> <p>6. Head to the ESPHome Integrations page</p> <p>7. Click device as shown in the image below</p> <p></p> <p>8. Scroll down until you get to the Configuration section and you see the empty boxes for zones 1-3 for both X and Y coordinates.</p> <p>Suggested settings</p> <ul> <li>Multi Target Tracking toggled on helps it detect up to three targets better.</li> <li>Zone Type allows you to select Disabled, Detection, or Filter.</li> <li>Disabled: Disable zone area detection.</li> <li>Detection: Only detects targets in the specified zone.</li> <li>Filter: Excludes a zone from detection.</li> </ul> <p>9. Now we can input our Zone 1-3 X and Y values to make our zones. Using the visual card from above, we can walk, sit, or stand in the area where we want to create a detection or non-detection zone. Input values for X are -7000 mm to 7000 mm, and the Y values are 0 mm to 7000 mm.</p> <p></p> <p>Helpful Hints to understand zones better!</p> <ul> <li> <p>X1 must always be less than X2, and Y1 must always be less than Y2.</p> </li> <li> <p>The Y axis is easier since it's never negative.</p> </li> </ul> <p> </p> <ul> <li>The X axis is where you can get tripped up, especially when both values are negative: -3456 is less than -2345.</li> <li>The Plotly chart will still render the rectangles even if the X1/X2 and Y1/Y2 values are reversed.</li> <li>The zones cannot overlap.</li> </ul> <p>10. If you use the imperial system (Freedom Units) then you will need to do this step. Metric users can skip this. For the targets to show up correctly we first need to update the Target 1-3 X and Y measurements from inches (in) to millimeters (mm). Find Target 1-3 X and Y under the Sensors section and select them. You will want to update all 3 X and Y target values.</p> <p></p> <p>11. Select the Settings cog in the top right.</p> <p></p> <p>12. Change the unit of measurement to mm and select Update.</p> <p></p> <p>13. Your X and Y Targets will now look like this.</p> <p></p> <p>14. Now you should see targets on the card.</p> <p></p> <p>15. Now we can make zones around the targets where you want to Detect presence or filter them out.</p> <p>Tip for zone configuration resetting</p> <p>If your zone configurations are not saved when restarting the device then try turning on the LD2450 Bluetooth for a few seconds and then turning it off again. You can also try to toggle on Multi Target Radar. This should wake up the mmWave module and retrieve your saved zones</p>"},{"location":"homey/products/mtr1/setup/zones-hlk/","title":"HLK Radar Tool App","text":""},{"location":"homey/products/mtr1/setup/zones-hlk/#configure-zones","title":"Configure Zones","text":"<p>Ensure that the LD2450 firmware version is V2.02.23090617 or later for proper integration functionality. </p> <p>The newer version of the firmware includes an \"auto calibrate\" function so you might want to test it out!</p> <p>The HLK-LD2450 mmWave sensor is used in the MTR-1.

Can I use it outdoors?</p> <ul> <li>The TEMP-1 is primarily designed for indoor use, but components like the waterproof soil probe are suited for harsh conditions. The main body is not rated for outdoor use without additional protection.</li> </ul> <p>4. How does the TEMP-1 connect to Home Assistant?</p> <ul> <li>The TEMP-1 connects via WiFi to ESPHome on Home Assistant, enabling data monitoring, automations, and alerts directly within Home Assistant.</li> </ul> <p>5. How often does the TEMP-1 send sensor data?</p> <ul> <li>The TEMP-1\u2019s reporting frequency is adjustable in ESPHome but most things default to 60seconds. You can set it for frequent updates or extend intervals to conserve battery life.</li> </ul> <p>6. Can I customize the TEMP-1 functionality?</p> <ul> <li>Absolutely! With ESPHome, users can modify firmware, settings, and even print custom cases for the TEMP-1. Our YAML is on Github and our .STEP and .STL CAD files are available for community use.</li> </ul> <p>7. What are the RGB LED and piezo buzzer used for?</p> <ul> <li>The RGB LED provides visual alerts, while the piezo buzzer offers audio notifications for events like low moisture levels or high UV exposure.</li> </ul> <p>8. Is the TEMP-1 compatible with other smart home platforms?</p> <ul> <li>While designed for Home Assistant via ESPHome, it may be compatible with other platforms using the ESPHome API or MQTT.</li> </ul> <p>9. Do I need coding knowledge to use the TEMP-1?</p> <ul> <li>Basic knowledge of Home Assistant and ESPHome is helpful, but most users can utilize it out of the box. For advanced customization, YAML knowledge is recommended.</li> </ul> <p>10. Can I access data from the TEMP-1 remotely?</p> <ul> <li>Yes, you can access sensor data remotely via the Home Assistant dashboard if your setup is configured for remote access.</li> </ul> <p>11. What\u2019s the difference between the battery and non-battery versions?</p> <ul> <li>The TEMP-1B is battery-operated and slightly larger, while the non-battery (NB) version is compact and connects directly to a USB-C power source.</li> </ul> <p>12.

Perfect for grilling, baking, and food prep (not dishwasher safe).</li> </ul> <p>5. Is the TEMP-1B weatherproof? Can I use it outdoors?</p> <ul> <li>The TEMP-1B is primarily designed for indoor use, but components like the waterproof soil probe are suited for harsh conditions. The main body is not rated for outdoor use without additional protection.</li> </ul> <p>6. How does the TEMP-1B connect to Home Assistant?</p> <ul> <li>The TEMP-1B connects via WiFi to ESPHome on Home Assistant, enabling data monitoring, automations, and alerts directly within Home Assistant.</li> </ul> <p>7. How often does the TEMP-1B send sensor data?</p> <ul> <li>The TEMP-1B\u2019s reporting frequency is adjustable in ESPHome but most things default to 60seconds. You can set it for frequent updates or extend intervals to conserve battery life.</li> </ul> <p>8. Can I customize the TEMP-1B\u2019s functionality?</p> <ul> <li>Absolutely! With ESPHome, users can modify firmware, settings, and even print custom cases for the TEMP-1B. Our YAML is on Github and our .STEP and .STL CAD files are available for community use.</li> </ul> <p>9. What are the RGB LED and piezo buzzer used for?</p> <ul> <li>The RGB LED provides visual alerts, while the piezo buzzer offers audio notifications for events like low moisture levels or high UV exposure.</li> </ul> <p>10. Is the TEMP-1B compatible with other smart home platforms?</p> <ul> <li>While designed for Home Assistant via ESPHome, it may be compatible with other platforms using the ESPHome API or MQTT.</li> </ul> <p>11. Do I need coding knowledge to use the TEMP-1B?</p> <ul> <li>Basic knowledge of Home Assistant and ESPHome is helpful, but most users can utilize it out of the box. For advanced customization, YAML knowledge is recommended.</li> </ul> <p>12. Can I access data from the TEMP-1B remotely?</p> <ul> <li>Yes, you can access sensor data remotely via the Home Assistant dashboard if your setup is configured for remote access.</li> </ul> <p>13. What\u2019s the difference between the battery and non-battery versions?</p> <ul> <li>The TEMP-1B is battery-operated and slightly larger, while the non-battery (NB) version is compact and requires USB-C power at 5 volts using 1amp or less (5W). They both have all of the same components for measuring soil moisture, air temp/humdity, lux/uv, etc.</li> </ul> <p>14. Can I use multiple TEMP-1B sensors in one Home Assistant setup?</p> <ul> <li>Yes, you can add multiple TEMP-1B sensors, each appearing as a separate device, for comprehensive monitoring across multiple plants or spaces.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"homey/products/temp1b/introduction/","title":"Introduction","text":""},{"location":"homey/products/temp1b/introduction/#introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"<p>The TEMP-1B (16340 battery) can be used with an optional temperature probe which come in two lengths or a food safe grill probe.

What sensors are included in the AIR-1?</p> <ul> <li>The AIR-1 uses a SEN55 which includes sensors for PM1, PM2.5, PM4, PM10 (particulate matter), VOC Index (volatile organic compounds), NOx Index (nitrogen oxides), temperature, and humidity. Addon sensors include the SCD40 CO2 and the MiCS gas sensor.</li> </ul> <p>2. What does the AIR-1 measure?</p> <ul> <li>The AIR-1 measures a variety of air quality metrics, including particulate matter (dust, pollen, etc.), VOCs, NOx, temperature, and humidity. The optional CO2 sensor can track carbon dioxide levels, and the pressure sensor helps provide more accurate CO2 readings.</li> </ul> <p>3. How do I connect the AIR-1 to Home Assistant?</p> <ul> <li>The AIR-1 connects via WiFi to ESPHome on Home Assistant, enabling data monitoring, automations, and alerts directly within Home Assistant.</li> </ul> <p>4. Does the AIR-1 require cloud connectivity or a subscription?</p> <ul> <li>No, the AIR-1 is fully local and does not require any cloud services or subscriptions. All data is processed and stored locally via your Home Assistant setup, ensuring privacy and control over your data.</li> </ul> <p>5. What are common use cases for the AIR-1?</p> <ul> <li>The AIR-1 is ideal for monitoring indoor air quality, such as tracking dust levels in woodworking shops, ensuring optimal air quality during sleep, or automating air purifiers when certain thresholds are met. The CO2 sensor is particularly useful for identifying high CO2 levels, which can affect sleep and concentration.</li> </ul> <p>6. How do I set up automations with the AIR-1?</p> <ul> <li>Using Home Assistant, you can set up automations based on the AIR-1\u2019s sensor readings. For example, you can automate an HVAC fan to run when CO2 levels are high, or trigger notifications when particulate matter reaches unhealthy levels.</li> </ul> <p>7. How does the optional CO2 sensor work?</p> <ul> <li>The optional SCD40 CO2 sensor measures carbon dioxide levels and helps you understand when CO2 concentrations in a room become too high, which can cause fatigue, drowsiness, and worse for humans and pets alike. It\u2019s particularly useful in offices, bedrooms, and other enclosed spaces.</li> </ul> <p>8. What is particulate matter (PM) and why is it important?</p> <ul> <li>Particulate matter (PM) refers to tiny particles in the air that can be harmful when inhaled. The AIR-1 measures various sizes of particulate matter (PM1, PM2.5, PM4, PM10), helping you track dust, pollen, and other particles that affect air quality. It\u2019s especially useful for people with allergies or respiratory conditions.</li> </ul> <p>9. What is VOC and why should I monitor it?</p> <ul> <li>VOCs (volatile organic compounds) are chemicals that can be emitted from everyday items like cleaning products, paints, and furniture. Prolonged exposure to high levels of VOCs can affect indoor air quality and health. The AIR-1\u2019s VOC sensor helps you monitor these levels and take action when necessary, such as increasing ventilation.</li> </ul> <p>10. What is the NOx Index and why is it measured?</p> <ul> <li>NOx (nitrogen oxides) are harmful gases that contribute to air pollution and can affect respiratory health. The AIR-1 gives an NOx index number, allowing you to keep track of indoor air quality and make adjustments if necessary. \"The NO x Index describes the current NO x condition in a room relative to the sensor\u2019s recent history. In this way, the NO x Index behaves like a human nose. \"</li> </ul> <p>11. How accurate are the air quality readings from the AIR-1?</p> <ul> <li>The AIR-1 uses a high-quality SEN55 sensor with a 10-year lifespan, designed for continuous use. Its readings are highly accurate for particulate matter, VOC Index, and NOx Index. However, keep in mind that the ESP32-C3 generates some heat, which may require you to apply a temperature and humidity offset.</li> </ul> <p>12. How can I use the RGB LED for notifications?</p> <ul> <li>The RGB LED on the AIR-1 can be customized to show different colors for different events. For example, you can set it to flash red when air quality is poor, green on trash night, or blue when CO2 levels are safe. You can configure these notifications through Home Assistant.</li> </ul> <p>13. How do I update the firmware on the AIR-1?</p> <ul> <li>Firmware updates can be done over-the-air (OTA) using ESPHome. You will receive notifications when new firmware is available, and you can install updates directly through Home Assistant.</li> </ul> <p>14. How do I calibrate the CO2 sensor?</p> <ul> <li>The CO2 sensor comes pre-calibrated, so you don\u2019t need to perform any manual calibration. However, you can recalibrate the sensor through ESPHome if needed.</li> </ul> <p>15. Does the AIR-1 work outdoors?</p> <ul> <li>The AIR-1 is primarily designed for indoor use. It could be used outdoors in a sheltered environment, but it is not weatherproof. If you need outdoor air quality monitoring, ensure the device is protected from the elements.</li> </ul> <p>16. What is the power source for the AIR-1?</p> <ul> <li>The AIR-1 is powered via a USB-C connection. It can be plugged into any standard wall outlet using a 5V adapter.</li> </ul> <p>17. How does the pressure sensor help with CO2 readings?</p> <ul> <li>The barometric pressure sensor (DPS310) enhances the accuracy of CO2 readings by compensating for changes in altitude and atmospheric pressure, ensuring more reliable measurements of CO2 levels in different environments.</li> </ul> <p>18. My AIR-1 CO2 sensors are having a sawtooth pattern, is there any explanation?</p> <ul> <li>Some users have noticed the AIR-1 with the \"Apollo\" side facing up will produce strange behavior with the CO2 sensor readings fluctuating way more than they should. Simply turning the AIR-1 to the other side makes this problem go away!</li> </ul> <p>19. Can I integrate multiple AIR-1 sensors in my smart home?</p> <ul> <li>Yes, you can have multiple AIR-1 sensors in your Home Assistant setup. Each sensor will be recognized as a separate entity, allowing you to monitor air quality across different rooms or spaces simultaneously.</li> </ul> <p>20. How customizable is the AIR-1?</p> <ul> <li>The AIR-1 is fully customizable via ESPHome. You can adjust sensor settings, create automations, modify reporting intervals, and even customize the RGB LEDs. Additionally, we provide open-source CAD drawings and code for further customization.</li> </ul> <p>21. How frequently does the AIR-1 report data?</p> <ul> <li>The reporting frequency for each sensor is adjustable via ESPHome but most default to 60 seconds. You can choose to have data reported as frequently as every second, or adjust intervals to save power and reduce data traffic.</li> </ul> <p>22. Does the AIR-1 require specific software?</p> <ul> <li>The AIR-1 is designed to work seamlessly with Home Assistant through ESPHome. All configuration, monitoring, and automation setups are done through these platforms.</li> </ul> <p>23. Is the AIR-1 compatible with other smart home platforms?</p> <ul> <li>While the AIR-1 is optimized for Home Assistant and ESPHome, you may be able to integrate it into other smart home platforms using custom configurations or MQTT, but Home Assistant remains the primary platform.</li> </ul> <p>24. What\u2019s the difference between the AIR-1 and other air quality sensors?</p> <ul> <li>The AIR-1 is unique because it offers local control with no cloud or subscription required. It also provides a wide range of sensor data (PM, VOC, NOx, CO2, temperature, humidity) in a compact, affordable package. The addition of the RGB LEDs and open-source nature makes it highly customizable.</li> </ul> <p>25. What are the optional add-ons for the AIR-1?</p> <ul> <li>The AIR-1 offers two optional add-ons: a SCD40 CO2 sensor and the MiCS gas sensor. These can be added to enhance air quality monitoring with very accurate CO2 measurements and the ability to detect multiple gases with the MiCS gas sensor.</li> </ul> <p>26. What\u2019s in the box?</p> <ul> <li>The AIR-1 comes with the fully assembled board and case, a USB-C power cable, and access to all our documentation, open-source code, and CAD models. You\u2019ll also receive a sticker of Apollo, our mascot.</li> </ul> <p>27. How do I install the AIR-1?</p> <ul> <li>Installation is easy. Simply plug the AIR-1 into a wall outlet using the USB-C cable, connect it to your Home Assistant through ESPHome, and configure the settings as desired. Detailed setup instructions are available in our documentation.</li> </ul> <p>28. What is the warranty on the AIR-1?</p> <ul> <li>The AIR-1 comes with a one-year warranty. If you encounter any issues, we provide support via email, Discord, and our community channels to ensure you\u2019re satisfied with the product.</li> </ul> <p>29. Can the AIR-1 be used to monitor 3D printer fumes?</p> <ul> <li>Yes, the AIR-1 can monitor air quality around 3D printers, especially particulate matter (PM) and VOCs emitted during the printing process. It can trigger alerts or automations when levels become unhealthy.</li> </ul> <p>30. How long does it take to set up the AIR-1?</p> <ul> <li>Setup typically takes around 5-10 minutes. Once powered and connected to WiFi, it can be configured quickly through ESPHome and Home Assistant.</li> </ul> <p>31. How secure is the AIR-1?</p> <ul> <li>The AIR-1 operates entirely on your local network and does not send data to the cloud. All information is processed and stored locally, ensuring the security and privacy of your home automation setup.</li> </ul> <p>32. Can I use the AIR-1 for safety monitoring (e.g., CO2 or gas leaks)?</p> <ul> <li>The AIR-1\u2019s CO2 and gas sensors are intended for air quality monitoring but DO NOT MEET the safety standards for CO2 or gas leak detection as defined by the NBIC, NFPA, or IFC. For safety purposes, dedicated gas or CO2 monitors should be used.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"products/air1/introduction/","title":"Introduction","text":""},{"location":"products/air1/introduction/#introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"<p>The Apollo AIR-1 is a compact, feature-rich air quality sensor designed for Home Assistant users.

In this tutorial, however, we will be focusing on adding an LED strip to your Apollo device.</p> <p>Materials Needed for tutorial:</p> <ul> <li>Apollo MSR-2, Apollo MTR-1, and all other future Apollo Automation products with the mezzanine port.</li> <li>Apollo GPIO Header</li> <li>ws2812b aka neopixel RGB led strip or similar. sk6812 RGBW strip will also work. I used BTF Lighting ws2812b 60 leds/meter and white PCB.</li> <li>Optional DuPont Cables for GPIO Header but any DuPont cables will do.</li> <li>USB-C cable and power brick to power MSR-2</li> </ul> <p>You are limited to 300mA of power output from the 5v port. You can either attach an external power supply and power the MSR-2 via 5v and gnd pins or work with the limited power output of the port</p> <p></p> <p>Above is an image of the GPIO Header and its pinouts. We can use ports 2,4,6,7 for our data channel to an LED strip or multiple LED strips. We will also use the top two ports which are ground and 5v for power.</p> <p>Did you know you can power the esp32 from the 5v and gnd pin? That means you can connect an external power supply and power it without the side USB port being used! This also allows for more power to be given to your LEDs!</p> <p>We cannot use the IO ports 0,1,18, or 19 for LEDs but you can use ports 0 and 1 for i2c sensors.</p> <p>Connecting the GPIO Header to the MSR-2</p> <p>The first thing we will do is remove our MSR-2 back plate and connect our GPIO Header to our MSR-2 and then put the new GPIO back plate on (blue).</p> <p>Step 1. Remove the backplate of the MSR-2</p> <p> </p> <p>Step 2. Line up the Xs shown on the msr-2 and the GPIO Header. They should both be facing in the same direction as shown below.</p> <p></p> <p>Step 3. Gently push down onto the GPIO Header as shown below:</p> <p></p> <p>Step 4. Confirm the GPIO Header is seated properly as shown below.</p> <p></p> <p>Step 5. Slide the GPIO Header back plate for the MSR-2 over your sensor and gently push down until it clicks into place.</p> <p></p> <p>If the back plate does not gently go onto the sensor please investigate and confirm it is in the right orientation.</p> <p>Connecting DuPont pins to proper GPIO ports Now we need to reference the GPIO pinout we looked at above and then connect three wires. You will need three male-to-male DuPont wires included in your kit. I suggest using red for power aka 5v, White for ground aka GND, and green for data aka port IO7. Most LED strips will also have this same color scheme and it's easier to match like colors together.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>You can add a bit of hot glue to the Dupont wires to hold them together. DO NOT put hot glue into the GPIO Header's female pins that will ruin the addon. I am only suggesting that you can hot-glue the Dupont pins outer shell themselves together to stiffen them up.</p> <p></p> <p>Connecting DuPont pins to LED Strip</p> <p>Next, we need to connect the other side of the Dupont pins to the LED strip. Most likely your LED strip will have a JST-SM connector which is a 3amp max connector with three wires connected: red for 5v, green for data, and white for gnd. We will be matching up our red, green, and white wires already attached to the GPIO add-on pins in the MSR-2 (using IO7 as the data pin for this tutorial)</p> <p> </p> <p>Make sure to connect to the correct side of the LED strip. The led strip will have an arrow going down the led strip showing one direction for the data line. you want the data channel going FROM the msr-2 TO the led strip going in a \"forward\" direction as shown below.</p> <p> </p> <p>Edit the YAML of your MSR-2 to let it know about your new LED strip</p> <p>Finally, we need to tell the MSR-2 that we connected an LED strip. We need to tell it how many LEDs we have and we need to tell it that it's our second LED since the built-in LED is the first. This tutorial assumes you are comfortable with the ESPHome dashboard.</p> <p>Step 1. Open ESPhome Dashboard and click edit to bring up the yaml your sensor is currently using.</p> <p></p> <p>You will see some YAML code here and you do NOT want to touch anything above line 20. If you need to, click your cursor at the end of wifi_password and hit enter to create a new line then make sure you backspace until you are \"flush\" with the line numbers like how wifi: is.</p> <p>Step 2. Copy the code below and paste it to line 20 in your ESPHome yaml for this device.</p> <pre><code>light:\n  - platform: esp32_rmt_led_strip\n    id: bed_led\n    name: \"Bed LED\"\n    pin: GPIO7\n    rmt_channel: 1\n    default_transition_length: 0s\n    chipset: WS2812\n    num_leds: 60\n    rgb_order: grb\n    effects:\n      - pulse:\n          name: \"Slow Pulse\"\n          transition_length: 1000ms\n          update_interval: 1000ms\n          min_brightness: 50%\n          max_brightness: 100%\n      - pulse:\n          name: \"Fast Pulse\"\n          transition_length: 100ms\n          update_interval: 100ms\n          min_brightness: 50%\n          max_brightness: 100%\n      - addressable_rainbow:\n</code></pre> <p>This is where you can change your number of LEDs as well as the GPIO pin used for the LED data! Make sure to check out https://esphome.io/components/light/index.html#light-effects for all the effects supported such as addressable scan effect!</p> <p>Step 3. Confirm you do not have any red lines showing errors in your codeYou change the rmt_channel to 1 because 0 is being used by the built-in LED of the MSR-2.</p> <p>Step 4. Hit save and then install in the top right. It should have a popup where you select \"wirelessly\" then it will begin compiling the firmware and finally installing the compiled firmware to your MSR-2.</p> <p>Step 5. Go into home assistant and confirm you now have a new light entity called Bed LED</p> <p></p> <p>Step 6. Click on the name \"Bed LED\" circled and it will pop up a color picker. You can then choose the color wheel option to pick any color of the rainbow, or select \"effect\" and choose an effect.</p> <p> </p> <p></p> <p> </p>"},{"location":"products/air1/examples/tim-air-1-erv-whole-home/","title":"Tim's AIR-1 ERV Whole Home Solution","text":""},{"location":"products/air1/examples/tim-air-1-erv-whole-home/#tims-air-1-erv-whole-home-solution","title":"Tim's AIR-1 ERV Whole Home Solution","text":"<p>esp32 C6 which drives two single phase inverters via two dac mcp4725 and four relays.

How long will the BTN-1 last on battery if it's not sleeping?</p> <ul> <li>It's expected to last 18 hours on a single charge if you need to take it on the go - great for all ESP-NOW projects!</li> </ul> <p>3. Why won't my BTN-1 multi presses work? Single press works fine!</p> <ul> <li>The device is most likely sleeping - when sleeping, no multi clicks are supported. Only a physical button single press because that wakes the device up.</li> </ul> <p>4. How do I connect the BTN-1 to Home Assistant?</p> <ul> <li>The BTN-1 connects to your Home Assistant instance through the ESPHome Integration using WiFi.</li> </ul> <p>5. Does the BTN-1 support Zigbee firmware?</p> <ul> <li>The BTN-1 uses an 8MB C6 mini MCU so it technically does support zigbee - we might have official firmware for this in the future!</li> </ul> <p>6. What kind of things can I do with the BTN-1?</p> <ul> <li>You can do all sorts of neat things with the BTN-1 such as using it to quickly trigger an automation, a scene, a script, or anything else in Home Assistant.</li> </ul> <p>7. What kind of power supply is required for the BTN-1?</p> <ul> <li>The BTN-1 is powered via USB-C and can be plugged into a standard wall outlet using a 5V 1A or bigger power supply.</li> </ul> <p>8. What addons are available for the BTN-1?</p> <ul> <li>The BTN-1 will have an upcoming OLED screen and NFC connector addon!</li> </ul> <p>9. Is the BTN-1 secure?</p> <ul> <li>The BTN-1 communicates over your local network using encrypted traffic with the ESPHome API. This provides a secure, local connection without the need for cloud services. No data is sent to external servers, ensuring privacy.</li> </ul> <p>10. What is the warranty for the BTN-1?</p> <ul> <li>The BTN-1 comes with a standard one-year warranty.

Ok, so looks like I've got signal strength tracking working for Apple watches by getting the mac address from the home assistant private ble device integration. Here's a quick write-up if anyone else is interested. The end of the doc has a complete configuration file example.</p> <pre><code># Tracking an Apple Watch in esphome\nUsing esphome on an Apollo msr-1 to track an Apple Watch\n\n## Acknowledgements:\nThe following github repo was used as a starting point for this configuration: https://github.com/dalehumby/ESPHome-Apple-Watch-detection\n\n## RSSI Tracking\n1.) Setup your apple watch in the \"Private BLE Device\" integration by following the instructions on the integration page: https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/private_ble_device/\n\n2.) Create a text sensor in the esphome config that grabs the apple watch current mac address from home assistant:\n```yaml\ntext_sensor:\n  - platform: homeassistant\n    name: \"Apple Watch Current MAC Address\"\n    id: apple_watch_mac\n    entity_id: device_tracker.your_apple_watch_home_assistant_id\n    attribute: current_address\n</code></pre> <p>3.)  Create a template sensor for storing and transmitting the rssi value:</p> <pre><code>sensor:\n  - platform: template\n    id: apple_watch_rssi\n    name: \"Apple Watch RSSI\"\n    device_class: signal_strength\n    unit_of_measurement: dBm\n    accuracy_decimals: 0\n    filters:\n      - exponential_moving_average:\n          alpha: 0.3\n          send_every: 1\n</code></pre> <p>4.) Create a custom ble tracker that uses the mac address from home assistant to match the device:</p> <pre><code>esp32_ble_tracker:\n  scan_parameters:\n    interval: 1.2s\n    window: 500ms\n    active: false\n  on_ble_advertise:\n    - then:\n      - lambda: |-\n          for (auto data : x.get_manufacturer_datas()) {\n            if(x.address_str() == id(apple_watch_mac).state) {\n              id(apple_watch_rssi).publish_state(x.get_rssi());\n            }\n          }\n</code></pre> <ol> <li>Ensure the power save mode for wifi is set to light (msr-1 defaults to using none which does not work with bluetooth tracking):</li> </ol> <pre><code>wifi:\n  power_save_mode: light\n</code></pre> <p>At this point if you install the changes on the device you should be successfully tracking the rssi for your apple watch. If you want you can optionally add some configuration for a basic presence detection sensor by doing the following:</p> <p>OPTIONAL PRESENCE DETECTION SECTION</p> <ol> <li>Create configuration values for detection signal strength:</li> </ol> <pre><code>number:\n  - platform: template\n    name: \"RSSI Presence Level\"\n    id: rssi_present\n    icon: \"mdi:arrow-collapse-right\"\n    optimistic: true\n    min_value: -100\n    max_value: -35\n    initial_value: -60\n    step: 1\n    entity_category: CONFIG\n    restore_value: true\n    update_interval: never\n  - platform: template\n    name: \"RSSI Absence Level\"\n    id: rssi_not_present\n    icon: \"mdi:arrow-collapse-right\"\n    optimistic: true\n    min_value: -100\n    max_value: -35\n    initial_value: -70\n    step: 1\n    entity_category: CONFIG\n    restore_value: true\n    update_interval: never\n</code></pre> <ol> <li>Create a sensor for storing and filtering the presence value:</li> </ol> <pre><code>sensor:\n  - platform: template\n    id: room_presence_debounce\n    filters:\n      - sliding_window_moving_average:\n          window_size: 3\n          send_every: 1\n</code></pre> <ol> <li>Create a sensor for transmitting the filtered presence state:</li> </ol> <pre><code>binary_sensor:\n  - platform: template\n    id: room_presence\n    name: \"Apple Watch Presence\"\n    device_class: occupancy\n    lambda: |-\n      if (id(room_presence_debounce).state &gt;

Should be all set!\n\n##### Thanks to our Discord user albuquerquefx for the information below!\n\n\n\nFor those interested in using their MSR-1 as a Bluetooth proxy while also actively scanning for BLE devices, you'll need to add the following to your ESP32 YAML file (I'm using a 1.5-second scan interval with a 750ms window for sensing BLE beacons):\n\nesp32\\_ble\\_tracker:\n id: ${name}\\_ble\\_tracker\n scan\\_parameters:\n interval: 1500ms\n window: 750ms\n active: true\n\nbluetooth\\_proxy:\n active: true\n\nAdditionally, you need to include this entry in your existing Wi-Fi section:\n\npower\\_save\\_mode: light\n\nOnce complete, after a few minutes within the presence of any iBeacon device within listening distance of your MSR-1, Home Assistant should announce the presence of an iBeacon Tracker integration on your settings page. While I didn't capture a screenshot of it, it's now installed and sensing things.\n\nIf you encounter a device with a blank name (e.g., anything Android), you'll need to click \"Configure\" and enter the UUID manually. This is because Home Assistant does not allow devices with empty names (interestingly, their own companion app permits forcing an Android to become an iBeacon but then doesn't require a name field).\n\nFor devices where you don't know the IRK, you may have to wait about 300 seconds for your iBeacon Tracker to process 10 different iterations of the same UUID but with the last four characters randomly changed. Once ten instances have appeared, the iBeacon Tracker integration should recognize they're all the same device and combine them into a single tracker element. Just be patient, though it can be a bit frustrating.\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"products/general/setup/change-the-update-frequency-of-sensors/","title":"How To Change The Update Frequency Of Sensors","text":""},{"location":"products/general/setup/change-the-update-frequency-of-sensors/#how-to-change-the-update-frequency-of-sensors","title":"How To Change The Update Frequency Of Sensors","text":"<p>1.

In this tutorial, however, we will be focusing on adding an LED strip to your Apollo device.</p> <p>Materials Needed for tutorial:</p> <ul> <li>Apollo MSR-2, Apollo MTR-1, Apollo Air-1 and all other future Apollo Automation products with the mezzanine port.</li> <li>Apollo GPIO Header</li> <li>ws2812b aka neopixel RGB led strip or similar. sk6812 RGBW strip will also work.</li> <li>Optional DuPont Cables for GPIO Header but any DuPont cables will do.</li> <li>USB-C cable and power brick to power MSR-2</li> </ul> <p>You are limited to 300mA of power output from the 5v port. You can either attach an external power supply and power the MSR-2 via 5v and gnd pins or work with the limited power output of the port</p> <p></p> <p>Above is an image of the GPIO Header and its pinouts. We can use ports 2,4,6,7 for our data channel to an LED strip or multiple LED strips. We will also use the top two ports which are ground and 5v for power.</p> <p>Did you know you can power the esp32 from the 5v and gnd pin? That means you can connect an external power supply and power it without the side USB port being used! This also allows for more power to be given to your LEDs!</p> <p>We cannot use the IO ports 0,1,18, or 19 for LEDs but you can use ports 0 and 1 for i2c sensors.</p> <p>Connecting the GPIO Header to the MSR-2</p> <p>The first thing we will do is remove our MSR-2 back plate and connect our GPIO Header to our MSR-2 and then put the new GPIO back plate on (blue).</p> <p>Step 1. Remove the backplate of the MSR-2</p> <p> </p> <p>Step 2. Line up the Xs shown on the msr-2 and the GPIO Header. They should both be facing in the same direction as shown below.</p> <p></p> <p>Step 3. Gently push down onto the GPIO Header as shown below:</p> <p></p> <p>Step 4. Confirm the GPIO Header is seated properly as shown below.</p> <p></p> <p>Step 5. Slide the GPIO Header back plate for the MSR-2 over your sensor and gently push down until it clicks into place.</p> <p></p> <p>If the back plate does not gently go onto the sensor please investigate and confirm it is in the right orientation.</p> <p>Connecting DuPont pins to proper GPIO ports Now we need to reference the GPIO pinout we looked at above and then connect three wires. You will need three male-to-male DuPont wires included in your kit. I suggest using red for power aka 5v, White for ground aka GND, and green for data aka port IO7. Most LED strips will also have this same color scheme and it's easier to match like colors together.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>You can add a bit of hot glue to the Dupont wires to hold them together. DO NOT put hot glue into the GPIO Header's female pins that will ruin the addon. I am only suggesting that you can hot-glue the Dupont pins outer shell themselves together to stiffen them up.</p> <p></p> <p>Connecting DuPont pins to LED Strip</p> <p>Next, we need to connect the other side of the Dupont pins to the LED strip. Most likely your LED strip will have a JST-SM connector which is a 3amp max connector with three wires connected: red for 5v, green for data, and white for gnd. We will be matching up our red, green, and white wires already attached to the GPIO add-on pins in the MSR-2 (using IO7 as the data pin for this tutorial)</p> <p> </p> <p>Make sure to connect to the correct side of the LED strip. The led strip will have an arrow going down the led strip showing one direction for the data line. you want the data channel going FROM the msr-2 TO the led strip going in a \"forward\" direction as shown below.</p> <p> </p> <p>Edit the YAML of your MSR-2 to let it know about your new LED strip</p> <p>Finally, we need to tell the MSR-2 that we connected an LED strip. We need to tell it how many LEDs we have and we need to tell it that it's our second LED since the built-in LED is the first. This tutorial assumes you are comfortable with the ESPHome dashboard.</p> <p>Step 1. Open ESPhome Dashboard and click edit to bring up the yaml your sensor is currently using.</p> <p></p> <p>You will see some YAML code here and you do NOT want to touch anything above line 20. If you need to, click your cursor at the end of wifi_password and hit enter to create a new line then make sure you backspace until you are \"flush\" with the line numbers like how wifi: is.</p> <p>Step 2. Copy the code below and paste it to line 20 in your ESPHome yaml for this device.</p> <pre><code>light:\n  - platform: esp32_rmt_led_strip\n    id: bed_led\n    name: \"Bed LED\"\n    pin: GPIO7\n    rmt_channel: 1\n    default_transition_length: 0s\n    chipset: WS2812\n    num_leds: 60\n    rgb_order: grb\n    effects:\n      - pulse:\n          name: \"Slow Pulse\"\n          transition_length: 1000ms\n          update_interval: 1000ms\n          min_brightness: 50%\n          max_brightness: 100%\n      - pulse:\n          name: \"Fast Pulse\"\n          transition_length: 100ms\n          update_interval: 100ms\n          min_brightness: 50%\n          max_brightness: 100%\n      - addressable_rainbow:\n</code></pre> <p>This is where you can change your number of LEDs as well as the GPIO pin used for the LED data! Make sure to check out https://esphome.io/components/light/index.html#light-effects for all the effects supported such as addressable scan effect!Step 3. Confirm you do not have any red lines showing errors in your code You change the rmt_channel to 1 because 0 is being used by the built-in LED of the MSR-2. Step 4. Hit save and then install in the top right. It should have a popup where you select \"wirelessly\" then it will begin compiling the firmware and finally installing the compiled firmware to your MSR-2.Step 5. Go into home assistant and confirm you now have a new light entity called Bed LED</p> <p></p> <p>Step 6. Click on the name \"Bed LED\" circled and it will pop up a color picker. You can then choose the color wheel option to pick any color of the rainbow, or select \"effect\" and choose an effect.</p> <p> </p> <p></p> <p>That's all folks!

The output voltage is the same as the input voltage, so please make sure you buy the same 5 V, or 12 V, or 24 V power supply and LED strips.</li> </ul> <p>2. How long of an LED strip can I use with the LED-1?</p> <ul> <li>The length of LED strips depends more on other factors like voltage drop. Ultimately, we suggest going 3 meters with 5 V for each output, so 3 meters + 3 meters connected to separate outputs. You can go up to 5 meters at 24 V without seeing much voltage drop though!</li> </ul> <p>3. Can I use a remote with the LED-1?</p> <ul> <li>Although the device does not come with IR, it does support the WizMote over \"ESP-NOW\" and this works great inside of WLED!</li> </ul> <p>4. How does the microphone work?</p> <ul> <li>Audio-reactive WLED is built into the WLED firmware we ship with the LED-1.

Click Open Webui and navigate to your configuration.yaml file.</p> <p></p> <p>This file is used by Home Assistant and must be carefully edited.</p> <p>Home Assistant depends on this file to function correctly. Only make the changes exactly as outlined below. Do not add extra spaces or modify anything beyond what is specified in the instructions.</p> <p>2. Fill in the YAML generator below with your own entity IDs. When you are done, click Copy to Clipboard at the bottom then move to step 3.</p> <p>3. Head back to the configuration.yaml file you opened in step 1 and paste your yaml generated on to a new line at the bottom of the YAML file.</p> <p></p> <p>4. Click on Developer Tools then Check Configuration - as long as there is a green response you are safe to continue. Scroll down and click on Restful Command. Click Actions at the top and type in \"matrix\" then click on the new matrix command you just made and click Perform Action.</p> <p></p> <p>5. Create a new Automation that uses a time pattern trigger to trigger every minute.</p> <p></p> <p>6. Create an Action aka \"Then do\" and type in matrix then click the \"RESTful command: matrix_all_segments\" option. Click Save and name the automation when you are done. This will make the matrix update every 1 minute!</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"products/m1/setup/getting-started-m1/","title":"Getting Started","text":""},{"location":"products/m1/setup/getting-started-m1/#getting-started","title":"Getting Started","text":"<p>Congrats on your new M-1!

What sensors are included in the MSR-1?</p> <ul> <li>The MSR-1 includes a mmWave radar sensor (HLK-ld2410b), a LUX and UV sensor (LTR-390UV), and a temperature, humidity, and pressure sensor (BME280). It also has an optional CO2 sensor (SCD40), RGB LED, and piezo buzzer.</li> </ul> <p>2. What does the mmWave radar sensor do?</p> <ul> <li>The mmWave radar sensor detects motion, even subtle movements. It can be used for automation tasks like turning on lights when someone enters a room or keeping them on while someone is sitting still. It\u2019s also effective for detecting presence in spaces like beds or workstations.</li> </ul> <p>3. How does the MSR-1 connect to Home Assistant?</p> <ul> <li>The MSR-1 connects to Home Assistant through ESPHome using WiFi. Once connected, you can configure automations, monitor sensor data, and customize settings from Home Assistant.</li> </ul> <p>4. Does the MSR-1 require any cloud service or subscription?</p> <ul> <li>No, the MSR-1 is fully local and does not rely on cloud services or subscriptions. It operates entirely within your Home Assistant setup, ensuring privacy and data security.</li> </ul> <p>5. What are the use cases for the MSR-1?</p> <ul> <li>The MSR-1 is versatile and can be used for various home automation tasks, such as detecting when someone enters a room to turn on lights, monitoring CO2 levels, measuring sunlight (UV) to optimize plant care, or providing notifications using the RGB LED or piezo buzzer.</li> </ul> <p>6. What does the optional CO2 sensor measure?</p> <ul> <li>The optional CO2 sensor (SCD40) tracks carbon dioxide levels, which can affect air quality and personal comfort. High CO2 levels can cause drowsiness, poor sleep, and brain fog. The sensor can notify you when it\u2019s time to open a window or increase ventilation.</li> </ul> <p>7. How does the RGB LED work?</p> <ul> <li>The RGB LED on the MSR-1 can be used for visual notifications. For example, it can turn red when CO2 levels are high, green for trash night, or blue when the mail arrives. These alerts can be fully customized using Home Assistant.</li> </ul> <p>8. Can the piezo buzzer be customized?</p> <ul> <li>Yes, the piezo buzzer can be programmed to emit different beep patterns based on events. For instance, you can set it to beep when the front door opens, when the CO2 levels rise, or even play a fun tune for a party.</li> </ul> <p>9. What is the purpose of the LUX and UV sensors?</p> <ul> <li>The LUX and UV sensors (LTR-390UV) help monitor light levels and UV exposure. You can use these sensors to control indoor lighting based on natural light conditions or to track the amount of sunlight in a specific area, such as near plants.</li> </ul> <p>10. How accurate are the temperature and humidity readings?</p> <ul> <li>The MSR-1 uses the BME280 sensor for temperature, humidity, and pressure. It provides accurate readings, but keep in mind that the ESP32-C3 processor generates some heat, which may require a temperature offset for the most precise measurements.</li> </ul> <p>11. What does the pressure sensor do?</p> <ul> <li>The pressure sensor enhances the accuracy of CO2 readings by accounting for changes in atmospheric pressure. This helps provide more reliable air quality data.</li> </ul> <p>12. How do I install the MSR-1?</p> <ul> <li>Installation is straightforward. The MSR-1 is powered via a USB-C cable connected to a standard power adapter. Once powered on, it can be configured through Home Assistant using ESPHome.</li> </ul> <p>13. Can I customize the MSR-1?</p> <ul> <li>Yes, the MSR-1 is fully customizable. We provide open-source code and CAD files for you to modify and enhance. You can create automations, adjust sensor settings, and modify reporting intervals based on your needs.</li> </ul> <p>14. What is the mmWave detection range?</p> <ul> <li>The mmWave radar sensor can detect movement up to 5 meters (16.4 feet) with a detection angle of about 60 degrees (though in practice, this can be close to 90 degrees). It\u2019s excellent for detecting both large and small movements, making it suitable for automations like turning on lights or detecting presence in a room.</li> </ul> <p>15. Can the mmWave sensor detect through walls?</p> <ul> <li>Yes, mmWave sensors can detect movement through walls, depending on the material and thickness. This means you may need to fine-tune the sensor\u2019s settings to prevent false positives or adjust its placement to avoid unwanted detections.</li> </ul> <p>16. How do I set up automations with the MSR-1?</p> <ul> <li>Automations can be easily configured in Home Assistant using ESPHome. For example, you can automate lights to turn on when motion is detected or trigger a fan when CO2 levels rise. The sensor data can be used in combination with other Home Assistant devices for more complex automations.</li> </ul> <p>17. What is the power source for the MSR-1?</p> <ul> <li>The MSR-1 is powered via USB-C. Simply plug it into a standard 5V USB power adapter, and you\u2019re good to go.</li> </ul> <p>18. What is the reporting interval for the MSR-1 sensors?</p> <ul> <li>The reporting interval is adjustable via ESPHome. You can configure the sensors to report data as frequently as every second or set longer intervals depending on your specific needs.</li> </ul> <p>19. Can I use the MSR-1 outdoors?</p> <ul> <li>The MSR-1 is designed for indoor use. While it could be used outdoors in a sheltered environment, it is not weatherproof. If you plan to use it outdoors, make sure to protect it from the elements.</li> </ul> <p>20. What is the maximum number of targets for the mmWave sensor?</p> <ul> <li>The mmWave sensor on the MSR-1 is designed to detect a single target at a time. It is excellent for recognizing motion within a specific area, such as a room, and keeping track of when someone is present.</li> </ul> <p>21. What is the Exposed GPIO feature on the MSR-1?</p> <ul> <li>The Exposed GPIO feature provides access to the GPIO pins, 3v, 5v, and I2C on the back of the MSR-1 board. This allows you to expand its capabilities by adding external sensors or other components. For example, you could add an external temperature sensor or other I2C devices.</li> </ul> <p>22. How do I update the firmware on the MSR-1?</p> <ul> <li>Firmware updates are done over-the-air (OTA) using ESPHome. You can update the firmware directly through Home Assistant when new versions are available.</li> </ul> <p>23. Does the MSR-1 support Bluetooth tracking?</p> <ul> <li>Yes, the MSR-1 has Bluetooth tracking capabilities through the ESP32-C3 chip. You can track Bluetooth devices such as phones, tablets, or beacons. This allows for automations based on proximity, such as turning on lights when you walk into a room with your phone.</li> </ul> <p>24. How do I calibrate the CO2 sensor?</p> <ul> <li>The optional CO2 sensor (SCD40) comes pre-calibrated, so no manual calibration is necessary. However, you can perform recalibration via ESPHome if needed.</li> </ul> <p>25. How can I use the MSR-1 for light control?</p> <ul> <li>The MSR-1\u2019s LUX sensor can be used to control indoor lighting. For example, you can set up automations to only turn on lights when motion is detected and the room is dark. The UV sensor can also help you track sunlight exposure, which is useful for managing indoor plant care.</li> </ul> <p>26. Does the MSR-1 work with other smart home platforms besides Home Assistant?</p> <ul> <li>The MSR-1 is designed to work with Home Assistant through ESPHome. While it may be possible to integrate it with other platforms using MQTT or custom configurations, Home Assistant remains the primary platform for full functionality.</li> </ul> <p>27. What are some creative automation ideas using the MSR-1?</p> <ul> <li> <p>The MSR-1 offers endless automation possibilities. You can:</p> </li> <li> <p>Use the mmWave sensor to automate lights based on motion and presence.</p> </li> <li> <p>Use the RGB LED to indicate specific events (e.g., trash night or mail delivery).</p> </li> <li> <p>Trigger the piezo buzzer for notifications, such as when CO2 levels are too high or when a door opens.</p> </li> <li> <p>Use the LUX sensor to control lights based on sunlight levels.</p> </li> </ul> <p>28. What\u2019s included in the MSR-1 package?</p> <ul> <li>The MSR-1 package includes the assembled board, case, and links to our documentation, open-source code, and CAD models. You\u2019ll also get an Apollo Automation sticker as a little bonus.</li> </ul> <p>29. What\u2019s the difference between the MSR-1 and MSR-2?</p> <ul> <li>The MSR-2 is an incremental update based on user feedback. It includes a compact design, improved sensor accuracy (such as a DPS310 pressure sensor), and an additional expansion slot for future accessories. The MSR-1 remains supported, but the MSR-2 is the recommended choice for new users.</li> </ul> <p>30. How do I get support for the MSR-1?</p> <ul> <li>You can get support through our Discord community, where you can ask questions and share your experiences with other users and the Apollo Automation team. We also provide extensive documentation on our GitHub and wiki pages.</li> </ul> <p> </p>"},{"location":"products/msr1/introduction/","title":"Introduction","text":"<p>The Apollo MSR-1 is a compact, community-driven multisensor designed for Home Assistant via ESPHome.

What sensors are included in the MSR-2?</p> <ul> <li>The MSR-2 includes several built-in sensors such as an mmWave radar for motion detection, a LUX and UV sensor, a temperature and pressure sensor, and an optional CO2 sensor.</li> </ul> <p>2. How does the mmWave radar sensor work?</p> <ul> <li>The mmWave radar sensor can detect movement, even subtle motions like someone sitting still in a room. It works by emitting radar waves that reflect off objects and detects motion based on the change in the signal. The sensor is highly effective in detecting people in a room, even through light walls.</li> </ul> <p>3. What is the maximum detection range of the mmWave radar?</p> <ul> <li>The HLK-LD2410B mmWave radar sensor has a maximum detection range of about 6 meters (19.6 feet) with multi-target tracking capabilities, making it ideal for room-wide monitoring.</li> </ul> <p>4. Can the MSR-2 detect multiple people?</p> <ul> <li>No, the MSR-2 supports single-target tracking only but it has better still detection than the MTR-1 which makes it uniquely suited for situations where you need to track a very still target like on a bed, couch, etc.</li> </ul> <p>5. What is the benefit of the LUX and UV sensor?</p> <ul> <li>The LUX sensor measures the amount of light in a room, while the UV sensor tracks the ultraviolet index from the sun. These readings can be used to automate lighting systems, such as turning on or off lights depending on the ambient brightness, or to measure sunlight exposure in a room.</li> </ul> <p>6. How does the optional CO2 sensor work?</p> <ul> <li>The optional SCD-40 CO2 sensor provides accurate carbon dioxide measurements and is useful for tracking air quality in enclosed spaces. This sensor can be used to automate HVAC systems, sending alerts when CO2 levels are too high and suggesting when to ventilate the area.</li> </ul> <p>7. How do I connect the MSR-2 to Home Assistant?</p> <ul> <li>The MSR-2 connects to your Home Assistant instance through ESPHome using WiFi. Once connected, you can monitor data from all the sensors and set up automations.</li> </ul> <p>8. What kind of automations can I create with the MSR-2?</p> <ul> <li>You can create a variety of automations, such as turning on lights when motion is detected, adjusting ventilation when CO2 levels rise, or triggering alarms based on motion or environmental changes.</li> </ul> <p>9. What are the RGB LED and piezo buzzer used for?</p> <ul> <li>The RGB LED provides visual alerts, while the piezo buzzer offers audio notifications for events like low moisture levels or high UV exposure.</li> </ul> <p>10. How do I adjust the sensitivity of the presence detection?</p> <ul> <li>Sensitivity adjustments can be made through the Home Assistant Device Page or HLK Radar Tool app allowing you to fine-tune the radar to avoid false positives or to increase its sensitivity for more precise detections.</li> </ul> <p>11. Does the mmWave sensor detect through walls?</p> <ul> <li>Yes, the mmWave sensor can detect movement through certain materials like thin walls, which is helpful in larger spaces but may require sensitivity adjustments if false positives occur due to adjacent rooms.</li> </ul> <p>12. Can the MSR-2 be used outdoors?</p> <ul> <li>No, the MSR-2 is primarily designed for indoor use and high humidity or temperatures too high or low could damage the device.</li> </ul> <p>13. What\u2019s new in the MSR-2 compared to the MSR-1?</p> <ul> <li>The MSR-2 introduces several improvements, including a smaller form factor, an additional expansion slot for future accessories, an updated DPS310 pressure sensor for more accurate readings, and improved temperature and pressure tracking.</li> </ul> <p>14. Can the MSR-2 track the exact location of people in a room?</p> <ul> <li>Yes, the MSR-2 uses multi-zone mmWave radar technology to track the approximate location of people within a room. It can determine whether someone is sitting, walking, or standing in different areas of the space.</li> </ul> <p>15. How does the temperature and pressure sensor work?</p> <ul> <li>The DPS310 sensor provides precise readings of air temperature and pressure, which are especially useful when combined with the optional CO2 sensor to improve air quality monitoring. Keep in mind the heat generated by the ESP32 may require a temperature offset adjustment in the configuration.</li> </ul> <p>16. What kind of power supply is required for the MSR-2?</p> <ul> <li>The MSR-2 is powered via USB-C and can be plugged into a standard wall outlet using a 5V adapter.</li> </ul> <p>17. Can I customize the MSR-2 functionality?</p> <ul> <li>Absolutely! With ESPHome, users can modify firmware, settings, and even print custom cases for the MSR-2. Our YAML is on Github and our .STEP and .STL CAD files are available for community use.</li> </ul> <p>18. How often does the MSR-2 report sensor data?</p> <ul> <li>The reporting frequency can be customized through the ESPHome YAML configuration. You can set it to report data as frequently as every second or reduce the frequency to save energy or bandwidth.</li> </ul> <p>19. Is the MSR-2 compatible with other smart home platforms?</p> <ul> <li>The MSR-2 is specifically designed for Home Assistant via ESPHome. While it could be compatible with other platforms through custom integrations, its primary functionality is optimized for Home Assistant.</li> </ul> <p>20. Can I use multiple MSR-2 sensors in my Home Assistant setup?</p> <ul> <li>Yes, you can have multiple MSR-2 sensors connected to the same Home Assistant instance. Each device will show up as a separate entity, allowing you to monitor and automate different rooms or areas in your home.</li> </ul> <p>21. What accessories are available for the MSR-2?</p> <ul> <li>The MSR-2 has an additional expansion slot for future accessories. Currently, accessories such as a USB-C wall plug mount and a ball mount for flexible positioning are available. We are also working on new expansion boards for future updates.</li> </ul> <p>22. Is the MSR-2 secure?</p> <ul> <li>The MSR-2 communicates over your local network using ESPHome, which provides a secure, local connection without the need for cloud services. No data is sent to external servers, ensuring privacy.</li> </ul> <p>23. How do I install and configure the MSR-2?</p> <ul> <li>Installation is straightforward, with the MSR-2 powered via USB-C and connecting to Home Assistant through WiFi. Configuration is done in ESPHome, where you can set sensor parameters, adjust automations, and more. We provide detailed documentation and support through our Discord community and GitHub.</li> </ul> <p>24.

In this tutorial, however, we will be focusing on adding an LED strip to your Apollo device.</p> <p>Materials Needed for tutorial:</p> <ul> <li>Apollo MSR-2, Apollo MTR-1, and all other future Apollo Automation products with the mezzanine port.</li> <li>Apollo GPIO Header</li> <li>ws2812b aka neopixel RGB led strip or similar. sk6812 RGBW strip will also work.</li> <li>Optional DuPont Cables for GPIO Header but any DuPont cables will do.</li> <li>USB-C cable and power brick to power MSR-2</li> </ul> <p>You are limited to 300mA of power output from the 5v port. You can either attach an external power supply and power the MSR-2 via 5v and gnd pins or work with the limited power output of the port</p> <p></p> <p>Above is an image of the GPIO Header and its pinouts. We can use ports 2,4,6,7 for our data channel to an LED strip or multiple LED strips. We will also use the top two ports which are ground and 5v for power.</p> <p>Did you know you can power the esp32 from the 5v and gnd pin? That means you can connect an external power supply and power it without the side USB port being used! This also allows for more power to be given to your LEDs!</p> <p>We cannot use the IO ports 0,1,18, or 19 for LEDs but you can use ports 0 and 1 for i2c sensors.</p> <p>Connecting the GPIO Header to the MSR-2</p> <p>The first thing we will do is remove our MSR-2 back plate and connect our GPIO Header to our MSR-2 and then put the new GPIO back plate on (blue).</p> <p>Step 1. Remove the backplate of the MSR-2</p> <p> </p> <p>Step 2. Line up the Xs shown on the msr-2 and the GPIO Header. They should both be facing in the same direction as shown below.</p> <p></p> <p>Step 3. Gently push down onto the GPIO Header as shown below:</p> <p></p> <p>Step 4. Confirm the GPIO Header is seated properly as shown below.</p> <p></p> <p>Step 5. Slide the GPIO Header back plate for the MSR-2 over your sensor and gently push down until it clicks into place.</p> <p></p> <p>If the back plate does not gently go onto the sensor please investigate and confirm it is in the right orientation.</p> <p>Connecting DuPont pins to proper GPIO ports Now we need to reference the GPIO pinout we looked at above and then connect three wires. You will need three male-to-male DuPont wires included in your kit. I suggest using red for power aka 5v, White for ground aka GND, and green for data aka port IO7. Most LED strips will also have this same color scheme and it's easier to match like colors together.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>You can add a bit of hot glue to the Dupont wires to hold them together. DO NOT put hot glue into the GPIO Header's female pins that will ruin the addon. I am only suggesting that you can hot-glue the Dupont pins outer shell themselves together to stiffen them up.</p> <p></p> <p>Connecting DuPont pins to LED Strip</p> <p>Next, we need to connect the other side of the Dupont pins to the LED strip. Most likely your LED strip will have a JST-SM connector which is a 3amp max connector with three wires connected: red for 5v, green for data, and white for gnd. We will be matching up our red, green, and white wires already attached to the GPIO add-on pins in the MSR-2 (using IO7 as the data pin for this tutorial)</p> <p> </p> <p>Make sure to connect to the correct side of the LED strip. The led strip will have an arrow going down the led strip showing one direction for the data line. you want the data channel going FROM the msr-2 TO the led strip going in a \"forward\" direction as shown below.</p> <p> </p> <p>Edit the YAML of your MSR-2 to let it know about your new LED strip</p> <p>Finally, we need to tell the MSR-2 that we connected an LED strip. We need to tell it how many LEDs we have and we need to tell it that it's our second LED since the built-in LED is the first. This tutorial assumes you are comfortable with the ESPHome dashboard.</p> <p>Step 1. Open ESPhome Dashboard and click edit to bring up the yaml your sensor is currently using.</p> <p></p> <p>You will see some YAML code here and you do NOT want to touch anything above line 20. If you need to, click your cursor at the end of wifi_password and hit enter to create a new line then make sure you backspace until you are \"flush\" with the line numbers like how wifi: is.</p> <p>Step 2. Copy the code below and paste it to line 20 in your ESPHome yaml for this device.</p> <pre><code>light:\n  - platform: esp32_rmt_led_strip\n    id: bed_led\n    name: \"Bed LED\"\n    pin: GPIO7\n    rmt_channel: 1\n    default_transition_length: 0s\n    chipset: WS2812\n    num_leds: 60\n    rgb_order: grb\n    effects:\n      - pulse:\n          name: \"Slow Pulse\"\n          transition_length: 1000ms\n          update_interval: 1000ms\n          min_brightness: 50%\n          max_brightness: 100%\n      - pulse:\n          name: \"Fast Pulse\"\n          transition_length: 100ms\n          update_interval: 100ms\n          min_brightness: 50%\n          max_brightness: 100%\n      - addressable_rainbow:\n</code></pre> <p>This is where you can change your number of LEDs as well as the GPIO pin used for the LED data! Make sure to check out https://esphome.io/components/light/index.html#light-effects for all the effects supported such as addressable scan effect!Step 3. Confirm you do not have any red lines showing errors in your code You change the rmt_channel to 1 because 0 is being used by the built-in LED of the MSR-2. Step 4. Hit save and then install in the top right. It should have a popup where you select \"wirelessly\" then it will begin compiling the firmware and finally installing the compiled firmware to your MSR-2.Step 5. Go into home assistant and confirm you now have a new light entity called Bed LED</p> <p></p> <p>Step 6. Click on the name \"Bed LED\" circled and it will pop up a color picker. You can then choose the color wheel option to pick any color of the rainbow, or select \"effect\" and choose an effect.</p> <p> </p> <p></p> <p>That's all folks!

This enables precise automation based on a person\u2019s location within the room.</li> </ul> <p>6. What is the benefit of the LUX and UV sensor?</p> <ul> <li>The LUX sensor measures the ambient light in the room, while the UV sensor tracks ultraviolet light exposure. This data can be used for automations like adjusting lighting levels, or providing alerts when sunlight is strong.</li> </ul> <p>7. How does the optional CO2 sensor work?</p> <ul> <li>The optional CO2 sensor measures the concentration of carbon dioxide in the air, which is important for monitoring air quality in enclosed spaces. High CO2 levels can lead to poor sleep, drowsiness, and other health issues, and the sensor can trigger automations to turn on fans or open windows.</li> </ul> <p>8. What are some common use cases for the MTR-1?</p> <ul> <li>The MTR-1 can be used to automate lights based on people\u2019s presence in a room, trigger alarms or notifications when someone enters a space, and adjust HVAC settings based on CO2 levels. Its precise tracking capabilities also make it great for monitoring multiple zones within a room, such as distinguishing when someone is at the stove versus the sink.</li> </ul> <p>9. How do I connect the MTR-1 to Home Assistant?</p> <ul> <li>The MTR-1 connects to Home Assistant through ESPHome using WiFi. Once connected, you can access data from all the sensors and create automations based on the sensor readings.</li> </ul> <p>10. What kind of automations can I set up with the MTR-1?</p> <ul> <li>You can create automations for turning lights on/off based on motion, adjusting air filtration when CO2 levels rise, and sending notifications when specific zones (like doorways) detect movement. The multi-target tracking allows for even more advanced automations, such as adjusting lights depending on where people are in the room.</li> </ul> <p>11. How do I adjust the sensitivity of the motion detection?</p> <ul> <li>Sensitivity can NOT be adjusted via the ESPHome configuration. The MTR-1 LD2450 mmWave sensor cannot be tuned like the MSR-2 can. The MTR-1 can set zones and track multiple users instead.</li> </ul> <p>12. Can the MTR-1 detect motion through walls?</p> <ul> <li>Yes, the mmWave radar in the MTR-1 can detect movement through certain materials, such as light walls or thin furniture, though you may need to adjust the zones to prevent false positives from nearby rooms. Please visit the tuning articles for more info!</li> </ul> <p>13. Can the MTR-1 be used outdoors?</p> <ul> <li>While the MTR-1 is primarily designed for indoor use, with proper weatherproofing and environmental protection, it could be used in sheltered outdoor environments. Be cautious of exposure to moisture or extreme weather.</li> </ul> <p>14. Does the MTR-1 work with other smart home platforms?</p> <ul> <li>The MTR-1 is designed to work seamlessly with Home Assistant via ESPHome. While it could potentially be integrated into other smart home platforms through custom configurations, its primary use case is for Home Assistant.</li> </ul> <p>15. How does the temperature and pressure sensor work?</p> <ul> <li>The temperature and pressure sensor provides accurate measurements for air temperature and barometric pressure. This data can be used in automations, such as controlling heating/cooling systems or monitoring environmental conditions.</li> </ul> <p>16. How is the MTR-1 powered?</p> <ul> <li>The MTR-1 is powered through a USB-C connection and can be plugged into a standard wall outlet using a 5V adapter.</li> </ul> <p>17. What is the purpose of the RGB LED and piezo buzzer?</p> <ul> <li>The RGB LED can display different colors for various events or alerts, such as turning red when air quality is poor or green for general notifications. The piezo buzzer can be used for sound alerts, such as a beep when motion is detected or a CO2 level warning.</li> </ul> <p>18. Can I customize the MTR-1\u2019s features?</p> <ul> <li>Yes, the MTR-1 is fully customizable through ESPHome. You can modify sensor settings, change reporting intervals, and create custom automations based on the sensor readings.</li> </ul> <p>19. What is the reporting frequency of the MTR-1\u2019s sensors?</p> <ul> <li>The reporting frequency for each sensor can be adjusted through the ESPHome YAML configuration. You can choose to report data as frequently as every second or extend the intervals to reduce power consumption.</li> </ul> <p>20. Can I use multiple MTR-1 sensors in my smart home setup?</p> <ul> <li>Yes, you can integrate multiple MTR-1 sensors into your Home Assistant system. Each will show up as a separate entity, allowing you to monitor multiple rooms or areas in your home simultaneously.</li> </ul> <p>21.

Enter your device\u2019s full name and optionally customize the names of the three zones using the tool below. Then click Generate YAML and Copy YAML.If you're unsure of your device name, go to the ESPHome Integrations page, select your device, and look for the full name.

Now we can input our Zone 1-3 X and Y values to make our zones. Using the visual card from above, we can walk, sit, or stand in the area where we want to create a detection or non-detection zone. Input values for X are -7000 mm to 7000 mm, and the Y values are 0 mm to 7000 mm.</p> <p></p> <p>Helpful Hints to understand zones better!</p> <ul> <li> <p>X1 must always be less than X2, and Y1 must always be less than Y2.</p> </li> <li> <p>The Y axis is easier since it's never negative.</p> </li> </ul> <p> </p> <ul> <li>The X axis is where you can get tripped up, especially when both values are negative: -3456 is less than -2345.</li> <li>The Plotly chart will still render the rectangles even if the X1/X2 and Y1/Y2 values are reversed.</li> <li>The zones cannot overlap.</li> </ul> <p>10. If you use the imperial system (Freedom Units) then you will need to do this step. Metric users can skip this. For the targets to show up correctly we first need to update the Target 1-3 X and Y measurements from inches (in) to millimeters (mm). Find Target 1-3 X and Y under the Sensors section and select them. You will want to update all 3 X and Y target values.</p> <p></p> <p>11. Select the Settings cog in the top right.</p> <p></p> <p>12.

What kind of automations can I set up with the PLT-1?</p> <ul> <li>You can create automations for plant care, such as setting notifications when soil moisture is low, turning on lights when LUX readings drop below a certain level, or adjusting your HVAC system based on air temperature and humidity around your plants.</li> </ul> <p>9. How often does the PLT-1 send sensor data?</p> <ul> <li>The update intervals for each sensor are configurable in ESPHome. For example, you can have the soil moisture sensor report every second or extend it to save battery power in the battery-powered version.</li> </ul> <p>10. Can I customize the PLT-1\u2019s functionality?</p> <ul> <li>Absolutely! With ESPHome, users can modify firmware, settings, and even print custom cases for the PLT-1B. Our YAML is on Github and our .STEP and .STL CAD files are available for community use.</li> </ul> <p>11. What are the RGB LED and piezo buzzer used for?</p> <ul> <li>The RGB LED provides visual alerts, while the piezo buzzer offers audio notifications for events like low moisture levels or high UV exposure.</li> </ul> <p>12. What is the benefit of using a conformal coating on the soil moisture sensor?</p> <ul> <li>The conformal coating protects the sensor from moisture-related degradation, improving its lifespan and durability.</li> </ul> <p>13. What plants are compatible with the PLT-1?</p> <ul> <li>Compatible with various indoor plants, the PLT-1B can apply ideal care conditions (e.g., light, humidity, moisture) using Open Plant Book with Home Assistant.</li> </ul> <p>14. Can I monitor multiple plants with one PLT-1?</p> <ul> <li>The PLT-1 is designed to monitor a single plant\u2019s environment. To monitor multiple plants, additional sensors are recommended.</li> </ul> <p>15. What makes the PLT-1 better than other plant sensors?</p> <ul> <li>The PLT-1B features a durable capacitive soil moisture sensor, real-time data reporting, and tracks various environmental factors\u2014all in one compact device that integrates seamlessly with Home Assistant.</li> </ul> <p>16. Is the PLT-1 compatible with other smart home platforms?</p> <ul> <li>While designed for Home Assistant via ESPHome, it may be compatible with other platforms using the ESPHome API or MQTT.</li> </ul> <p>17. Do I need coding knowledge to use the PLT-1?</p> <ul> <li>Basic knowledge of Home Assistant and ESPHome is helpful, but most users can utilize it out of the box. For advanced customization, YAML knowledge is recommended.</li> </ul> <p>18. Can I access data from the PLT-1 remotely?</p> <ul> <li>Yes, once connected to Home Assistant, you can access your sensor data remotely through your Home Assistant dashboard, provided your setup allows for remote access.</li> </ul> <p>20. Can I use multiple PLT-1 sensors in one Home Assistant setup?</p> <ul> <li>Yes, you can add multiple PLT-1B sensors, each appearing as a separate device, for comprehensive monitoring across multiple plants or spaces.</li> </ul> <p>21.

What sensors are included in the R-PRO-1?</p> <ul> <li>The R-PRO-1 includes several built-in sensors such as a LD2450 mmWave radar sensor and optional LD2412 mmWave radar for presence detection, a LUX and UV sensor, and an optional CO<sub>2</sub> sensor.</li> </ul> <p>2. How does the mmWave radar sensor work?</p> <ul> <li>The LD2450 emits millimeter-wave radar signals (at 24GHz) into the environment. When these signals hit a person or object, they bounce back. The sensor detects these returned signals and calculates key information.</li> </ul> <p>3. What is the maximum detection range of the mmWave radar?</p> <ul> <li>The HLK-LD2450 mmWave radar sensor has a maximum detection range of about 6 meters (19.6 feet) with multi-target tracking capabilities, making it ideal for room-wide monitoring.</li> <li>The optional HLK-LD2412 mmWave radar sensor has a maximum detection range of about 9 meters (29.5 feet) with single tracking capabilities and ability to tune moving and still energy which is perfect for still targets like sleeping in a bed, laying on a couch, etc.</li> </ul> <p>4. Can the R-PRO-1 detect multiple people?</p> <ul> <li>Yes, the R-PRO-1 comes with a LD2450 which can detect 3 people in up to 3 zones. The optional ld2412 addon will only detect one person.</li> </ul> <p>5. What is the benefit of the LUX and UV sensor?</p> <ul> <li>The LUX sensor measures the amount of light in a room, while the UV sensor tracks the ultraviolet index from the sun. These readings can be used to automate lighting systems, such as turning on or off lights depending on the ambient brightness, or to measure sunlight exposure in a room.</li> <li> <p>Mounting behind a faceplate or using ceiling mount removes ability for lux or UV to work properly</p> <p>There is no way for the lux or UV index to work properly if there is no light or uv able to hit the sensor.</p> </li> </ul> <p>6. How does the optional CO<sub>2</sub> sensor work?</p> <ul> <li>The optional SCD-40 CO<sub>2</sub> sensor provides accurate carbon dioxide measurements and is useful for tracking air quality in enclosed spaces. This sensor can be used to automate HVAC systems, sending alerts when CO<sub>2</sub> levels are too high and suggesting when to ventilate the area.</li> </ul> <p>7. How do I connect the R-PRO-1 to Home Assistant?</p> <ul> <li>The R-PRO-1 connects to your Home Assistant instance through ESPHome using WiFi. Once connected, you can switch to using the ethernet firmware. You can also reflash it to Ethernet firmware here.</li> </ul> <p>8. What kind of automations can I create with the R-PRO-1?</p> <ul> <li>You can create a variety of automations, such as turning on lights when motion is detected, adjusting ventilation when CO<sub>2</sub> levels rise, or triggering alarms based on motion or environmental changes.</li> </ul> <p>9. What is the RGB LED used for?</p> <ul> <li>The RGB LED provides visual alerts like high CO<sub>2</sub> levels!</li> </ul> <p>10. How do I adjust the sensitivity of the presence detection?</p> <ul> <li>Sensitivity adjustments can be made through the device's webserver which you can reach from its ip address or hostname.local in a browser, or Home Assistant Device Page, or HLK Radar Tool app allowing you to fine-tune the radar to avoid false positives or to increase its sensitivity for more precise detections.</li> </ul> <p>11. Does the mmWave sensor detect through walls?</p> <ul> <li>Yes, the mmWave sensor can detect movement through certain materials like drywall and thin wood. In some instances it will need to be tuned to make sure adjacent rooms are not triggering the sensor.</li> </ul> <p>12. Can the R-PRO-1 be used outdoors?</p> <ul> <li>No, the R-PRO-1 is primarily designed for indoor use and high humidity or temperatures too high or low could damage the device.</li> </ul> <p>13. Can the R-PRO-1 track the exact location of people in a room?</p> <ul> <li>Yes with the LD2450 mmWave sensor, it is able to reliably detect people in x/y coordinate 'zones' that you setup here.</li> <li>Yes, the R-PRO-1 uses multi-zone mmWave radar technology to track the approximate location of people within a room. It can determine whether someone is sitting, walking, or standing in different areas of the space.</li> </ul> <p>14. What kind of power supply is required for the R-PRO-1?</p> <ul> <li>The R-PRO-1 is powered via Ethernet (802.3 compliant) or USB-C and can be plugged into a standard wall outlet using a 5V 2A or bigger power supply.</li> </ul> <p>15. Can I customize the R-PRO-1 functionality?</p> <ul> <li>Absolutely! With ESPHome, users can modify firmware, settings, and even print custom cases for the R-PRO-1. Our YAML is on Github and our .STEP and .STL CAD files are available for community use.</li> </ul> <p>16. How often does the R-PRO-1 report sensor data?</p> <ul> <li>The reporting frequency can be customized through the ESPHome YAML configuration. You can set it to report data as frequently as every second or reduce the frequency to save energy or bandwidth. Defaults will be 60 seconds for most sensors, but the mmWave sensors will report immediately on change.</li> </ul> <p>17. Is the R-PRO-1 compatible with other smart home platforms?</p> <ul> <li>Yes, it is compatible with any system that can integrate with the ESPHome API. We also have a list of supported platforms.</li> </ul> <p>18. Can I use multiple R-PRO-1 sensors in my Home Assistant setup?</p> <ul> <li>Yes, you can have multiple R-PRO-1 sensors connected to the same Home Assistant instance. Each R-PRO-1 will show up as a separate device with a lot of entities to configure and automate on, allowing you to monitor and automate different rooms or areas in your home.</li> </ul> <p>19. What addons are available for the R-PRO-1?</p> <ul> <li>The R-PRO-1 has a mezzanine port for an optional SCD40 CO<sub>2</sub> sensor.
